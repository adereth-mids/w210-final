Under the previous order, the Senate will \\nresume consideration of the House message to accompany S. 3021, which \\nthe clerk will report.\\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\\n\\n       House message to accompany S. 3021, an Act to designate the \\n     United States courthouse located at 300 South Fourth Street \\n     in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as the ``Diana E.

The majority leader is recognized.\\n\\n\\n                       Resignation of Nikki Haley\\n\\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I want to convey a few words of \\nthanks to our dedicated Ambassador to the United Nations, who we just \\nlearned will be stepping down at the end of the year.\\n  Our Nation has benefited greatly from the tough, skilled leadership \\nthat Nikki Haley brought to the U.N. Her tenure will be remembered for \\nher proud reassertion of American moral leadership and her fearless \\nwillingness to turn a bright spotlight on critical challenges, from \\nIsraeli's sovereignty to Iran's sponsorship of regional violence.\\n  Ambassador Haley has been a key part of the administration's team \\nthat has faced down a wide variety of critical challenges, and she has \\ndone so with distinction.\\n  She took on this role after an impressive 6 years as Governor of \\nSouth Carolina and quickly proved to be both be a skillful advocate for \\nour national interest and a forceful spokeswoman for our principles.\\n  I hope this is not the end of Ambassador Haley's distinguished career \\nin public service. I thank her for her significant contributions to our \\ncountry.\\n\\n\\n                    Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\\n\\n  Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday, I was pleased to attend \\nthe ceremonial swearing-in for the newest member of our Supreme Court--\\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh.\\n  Justice Kavanaugh's remarks yesterday affirmed yet again what his \\nrecord and his testimony clearly told us: He will be a thoughtful, \\nfairminded Justice who is committed to applying our laws and our \\nConstitution as they are actually written.\\n  His confirmation last week was a victory for the very same principles \\nof fairness and justice we can now count on with him--along with his \\nfellow Justices--to uphold.\\n  Saturday's vote was also a victory for the Senate--for this \\ninstitution--and for the integrity of this institution. Reason and \\ndeliberation triumphed over what was literally--literally--an attempt \\nto sway the Senate using mob tactics. I wish this were an exaggeration, \\nbut it isn't.\\n  While many came to Washington peacefully to share their stories, the \\nloudest voices proved to be those of the politically motivated far \\nleft--the same far left special interests that had pledged total \\nopposition to any Supreme Court nominee before the ink\\n\\n[[Page S6704]]\\n\\nwas even dry on Justice Kennedy's retirement. They pulled out all the \\nstops. They did everything they could.\\n  When it became clear Justice Kavanaugh's nomination would not be \\nstopped on the merits--well, as we know, that was only the beginning. \\nThe far-left activists decided that the U.S. Senate and their Members \\nshould be harassed and intimidated wherever they might be--in a \\nrestaurant with family, getting out of their own car, or in their own \\nhomes; anything went.\\n  When they did not get their way, when these tactics failed to sway \\nus, they just turned up the anger even more. Protestors disregarded the \\nmen and women of the Capitol Police, trampled barricades, stormed the \\nsteps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court, climbed on statues, and \\ntried to literally shout down Senators right in the middle of a \\nrollcall vote in the Senate.\\n  When the dust settled, literally hundreds of arrests had been made. \\nExtraordinary security measures were required to protect the Senate, \\nthe Supreme Court, as well as the Kavanaugh family. Members of this \\nbody and Senate staff have received threats of violence and murder.\\n  After all that, I am afraid the far left had succeeded in only one \\nthing: They made it even more difficult for the vast majority of \\nAmericans to take them seriously. They made it difficult for most \\nAmericans to take these people seriously.\\n  The madness hasn't stopped. They are already signaling that even more \\ndrastic steps may be necessary now that Justice Kavanaugh is on the \\nCourt.\\n  Some leftwing publications are already trying to lay the groundwork \\nfor--you guessed it--literally packing the Court with more Justices. \\nThat is right. The far left has gone scrounging through the ash heap of \\nAmerican history, and they are bandying about that discredited fantasy \\nfrom back in the 1930s.\\n  In the meantime, while the groundwork is laid for that scheme, one \\nfar-left pressure group is already trying to circulate petitions that \\nJustice Kavanaugh should be impeached--Justice Kavanaugh should be \\nimpeached.\\n  The mob would like to make themselves perfectly clear. If Democrats \\nwere to retake Congress, ``progessives expect them to use their full \\npower to get Kavanaugh off the bench.''\\n  So it is pretty obvious. The all-consuming animosity toward this \\nnominee, independent of all the facts and all the evidence, is still \\nbeing stoked. The far-left mob is not letting up.\\n  Early today, former Secretary of State Clinton sent this signal as \\nclear as day--this is Secretary Clinton. She told CNN exactly how she \\nviews millions of Americans who hold different political views from her \\nown. Here is what she said:\\n\\n       You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to \\n     destroy what you stand for. . . . If we are fortunate enough \\n     to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility \\n     can start again.\\n\\n  No peace until they get their way? More of these unhinged tactics?\\n  Apparently, this is the left's rallying cry, but fortunately the \\nAmerican people know the fact-free politics of hate, fear, and \\nintimidation are not how we actually govern in our democratic Republic.\\n  The Senate and the Nation will not be intimidated.\\n\\n\\n                                S. 3021\\n\\n  Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, earlier this year, \\nthe President challenged us to seriously address our Nation's crumbling \\ninfrastructure. We have wasted no time in Congress on working to tackle \\nthis challenge in a bipartisan way.\\n  Here are just a few highlights: The funding bill for fiscal 2018 \\nincluded a $21 billion increase in infrastructure funding. We continue \\nto build on that significant commitment in our historic return to \\nregular appropriations for fiscal year 2019.\\n  Just last week, we passed the longest FAA reauthorization in more \\nthan three decades on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. This week, we \\nhave the chance to keep the momentum going and advance another major \\nvictory for the American infrastructure by passing America's Water \\nInfrastructure Act.\\n  Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper deserve a lot of credit \\nfor getting this important bipartisan legislation across the finish \\nline. Its importance for every State in our Nation really cannot be \\noverstated.\\n  America's ports and inland waterways give our producers access to \\nmarkets around the world. For example, more than 60 percent of our \\ngrain exports move through our inland waterways and so do other \\ncommodities such as fuel, coal, and agricultural inputs.\\n  No wonder the American Farm Bureau Federation wrote the Senate, \\nexplaining that this legislation ``will put America's inland waterways \\nand port infrastructure on a solid and sustainable foundation to \\ncontribute to U.S. economic growth, jobs and global competitiveness for \\ngenerations to come.''\\n  This legislation covers big projects, like deepening ports and \\nensuring the navigability of inland waterways, but it also focuses on \\nthe unique challenges our local communities face. It will help ensure \\naccess to functioning sewer systems and clean drinking water.\\n  On the last point, there is good reason why the chairman of the EPW \\nCommittee calls this legislation ``the most significant drinking water \\ninfrastructure bill in decades.'' When you look at its contents, it is \\nhard to reach any other conclusion.\\n  There is more support for our rural communities as they grapple with \\naging water, sewer, and flood control infrastructure. The legislation \\nincludes Senator Boozman's SRF-WIN Act, which puts low-interest \\nfinancing within reach for small and midsized rural communities, like \\nthose in my home State of Kentucky.\\n  For the first time in over 20 years, this legislation reauthorizes \\nFederal funding to States to help ensure the safety of our drinking \\nwater.\\n  The legislation also addresses environmental protection. To name just \\none example, it includes an important effort championed by Senator \\nRubio and Governor Scott to help address harmful algal blooms that have \\nplagued Florida's waterways. These are just a few of the significant \\naccomplishments this legislation secures. Dams and levees, flood \\ncontrol for our communities, safe drinking water, and sewer systems in \\ncommunities big and small.\\n\\n  The bill before us addresses real needs in my State and across \\nAmerica. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act later today.\\n\\n\\n                    Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\\n\\n  Now, on one final matter, I would like to conclude where I started, \\nwith a few words of thanks for a job well done. Justice Kavanaugh's \\nconfirmation could not have happened without the tireless work of so \\nmany. So while I certainly can't mention everyone who is deserving, I \\nwish to take a moment to express my gratitude.\\n  First, of course, is President Trump himself, for sending to the \\nSenate such a talented and qualified nominee. He and Vice President \\nPence are stalwart champions for the judiciary that the American people \\ndeserve.\\n  My deep gratitude also goes to White House Counsel Don McGahn. \\nWithout Don's total dedication to ensuring that Judge Kavanaugh \\nreceived a fair hearing, we would not be where we are today.\\n  Here in the Senate, I can't compliment enough our dear friend \\nChairman Grassley for his leadership of the Judiciary Committee. He \\nbalanced strong leadership with generosity and flexibility to all of \\nthe Members. He oversaw the most thorough, painstaking review of a \\nSupreme Court nominee in our Nation's history.\\n  Supporting Chairman Grassley and the committee, I would like to \\nmention the following individuals: Staff Director Kolan Davis, Chief \\nNominations Counsel Mike Davis, Steve Kenny, Lauren Mehler, Andrew \\nFerguson, Taylor Foy, Rachel Mitchell, Katharine Willey, Jessica Vu, \\nGeorge Hartman, Jill Kozeny, and Jennifer Heins in Senator Grassley's \\noffice, and an entire team of outstanding staff.\\n  Thanks are also due to the Republican Whip, Senator Cornyn, and his \\nexcellent team, led by Monica Popp, and also to all of the dedicated \\nfloor staff who make this body function: Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and \\nthe entire cloakroom team; the Secretary of the Senate, \\nParliamentarians, clerks, reporters of debates, Sergeant at Arms, and \\nour doorkeepers.\\n  On my own team, I really cannot imagine this process--or really, my \\noffice, at all--without the crucial leadership of Sharon Soderstrom, my \\nchief of\\n\\n[[Page S6705]]\\n\\nstaff. She works harder and achieves more, under more pressure, than \\nalmost anyone I have ever had the privilege of working with.\\n  Don Stewart, my deputy chief of staff, is the expert hand who helps \\nkeep us on course and shapes our communications strategy. Hazen \\nMarshall, my policy director, helped to keep this and other priorities \\non track, including the other bipartisan policy wins the Senate \\ndelivered during the nomination debate.\\n  John Abegg is my chief counsel and right-hand man for every step of \\nthis process. For 15 weeks, John poured his determination, his \\nexperience, and his wisdom into this process. He started working the \\nmoment Justice Kennedy announced he was stepping down and did not stop \\nuntil the gavel fell. We wouldn't be here without his work.\\n  I am grateful to my policy advisers, my communications team, and my \\noperations staff for all the hard work and late nights they poured into \\nthis process, and to Phil Maxson and my personal office team for their \\nassistance.\\n  But most important of all, I need to close with this. To the men and \\nwomen of the United States Capitol Police and to all of the other law \\nenforcement officers who kept Members, staff, and citizens safe, even \\nin extremely difficult and often hostile circumstances, we really can't \\nthank them enough. Our representative government and the rule of law \\ndepend on their dedication, their bravery, and their sacrifice. So \\nthank you so much for keeping the Senate safe.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                            Cancer Research\\n\\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it was good to get back home to Texas over \\nthe weekend and on Columbus Day. I had a chance to travel to far West \\nTexas, out to El Paso, TX, and catch up with some of my friends and \\nconstituents there on some important issues they care an awful lot \\nabout.\\n  While we in Washington have been focused on Brett Kavanaugh's \\nconfirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court for the last 90 days or so, a \\nlot of other important things have been happening back in Texas and \\naround the country.\\n  For example, on August 1, Dr. Jim Allison, affiliated with the \\nUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, won the Nobel \\nPrize in medicine, along with a researcher from Japan. This is really \\nimportant work. It was a culmination of 25 years of effort, and I am \\nsure something Jim would have never even dreamed of as he grew up in \\nthe small town of Alice, TX, 45 minutes from Corpus Christi. He has \\ncome a long way since then. We are very proud of him, and today we send \\nour congratulations to Dr. Allison and to the entire MD Anderson team \\non a tremendous accomplishment.\\n  Dr. Allison developed a new way to treat cancer using T cells. His \\nmethod unleashes a patient's immune system to attack tumors. In other \\nwords, it is your own immune system that is triggered to attack the \\ntumors that are attacking the patient. This is called immune checkpoint \\ntherapy. It has resulted in the development of numerous drugs that have \\nthe potential to save lives. None other than our former President, \\nJimmy Carter, is now cancer free because of this type of therapy, but \\nhe is just one of the most famous of many examples.\\n  In the not so distant past, cancer could be treated in only one of \\nthree ways: through surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. A friend of \\nmine gave me the book--I think it was a Pulitzer Prize winning book--\\ncalled ``The Emperor of All Maladies,'' which was also a documentary. \\nTo be honest, the way that the medical profession treated cancer in the \\nearly days was pretty primitive: surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. \\nBut now, thanks to people like Dr. Allison and MD Anderson, cancer \\npatients have other options.\\n  Dr. Allison is sometimes referred to as the ``Godfather of cancer \\nimmunotherapy,'' and the drugs he has helped to develop have now been \\napproved to treat not only melanoma and lung cancer but also Hodgkins \\nlymphoma and cancers of the kidney, bladder, liver and stomach.\\n  But despite the great strides made by this Nobel Prize-winning Texan, \\nimmunotherapy is still in the very early stages of development. Dr. \\nAllison said there are nearly 2,000 immunotherapy trials in progress \\naround the Nation, including 200 at MD Anderson alone. That gives my \\ncolleagues an idea of the number of people and the ongoing efforts that \\nare working to extend the scientific frontiers of cancer treatment.\\n  Much of this work, of course, would not be possible without the \\nfunding that is provided by the American taxpayer through State and \\nFederal funding. The National Institutes of Health remains the largest \\nfunding mechanism, but in Texas we have done our part by investing $3 \\nbillion over 10 years through the Cancer Prevention and Research \\nInstitute of Texas, commonly known as CPRIT.\\n  Here in the Senate and in the House, working together with the \\nadministration, we have been promoting cancer research in several \\noverlapping ways. I recently met with Dr. Shanlin Shah and learned \\nabout the fascinating proton therapy that MD Anderson has pioneered. \\nConversations like that are a great way that we in Congress, who are \\nobviously not experts, can try to stay on top of rapidly advancing \\nresearch.\\n  But even more important is what we do here collectively to fund that \\nresearch. We have increased funding by $2 billion to the National \\nInstitutes of Health. With that increase, close to $6 billion is now \\ngoing to the National Cancer Institute, and an additional $100 million \\nis being put toward the so-called Cancer Moonshot that Joe Biden and \\nothers touted and which all of us working together voted to create. The \\nMoonshot will accelerate research regarding high mortality cancers.\\n  As a part of the Moonshot initiative, the National Institutes of \\nHealth has partnered with biopharmaceutical companies to launch what is \\nknown as the Partnership for Accelerating Cancer or PACT, as it is \\ncalled. PACT is a 5-year public-private research collaboration totaling \\n$215 million. Hopefully, it will identify new biomarkers and develop \\nnew immunotherapy treatments.\\n  Dr. Allison, whom I mentioned earlier, has spoken about how crucial \\nthis government funding effort really is. Of course, like I said, while \\nwe are caught up in the fights of the day here on the floor of the \\nSenate, a lot of good work gets done that the American people don't \\nhear about. So that is why it is so important to emphasize this point.\\n  While biotech and pharmaceutical companies fund the late-stage \\nresearch that brings well-developed therapies into clinical trials, the \\nearly funding of basic science, which makes that possible, often comes \\nfrom the money provided by the U.S. Government through the National \\nInstitutes of Health. Without it, Dr. Allison said, ``many of the \\ntherapies that currently treat millions of cancer patients worldwide \\nsimply wouldn't exist.''\\n  That is an important point too. It is not just treating cancer here \\nin America. The science and the developments, the research and the \\ncures that are developed at places like MD Anderson Hospital in \\nHouston, TX, benefit the whole world.\\n  I remember one of the last times I was at MD Anderson for a townhall \\nmeeting with Senator McConnell, the majority leader, and Senator John \\nMcCain, our recently departed colleague from Arizona. At the time, I \\nwas told that patients from 90 different countries come to MD Anderson \\nin Houston, TX, because of their expertise treating cancer.\\n  So this is not just a local or national phenomenon. This is a \\nworldwide phenomenon.\\n  It is not just the government, of course, that helps to fund this \\nimportant research. Philanthropists are also invaluable when it comes \\nto this sort of research as well. I am thinking about my friends Peggy \\nand Lowry Mays of San Antonio, TX. Thanks to their generosity, San \\nAntonio's premier cancer center, which is one of only four in Texas \\nwith the National Cancer Institute's elite designation, is entering \\ninto an entirely new era. Their donations and their generosity will \\nprovide an endowment to support the director of the cancer center, and \\nit will also fund new faculty recruitment and retention initiatives for \\ngenerations to come. This is just another way\\n\\n[[Page S6706]]\\n\\nthat generous people with big hearts are making a difference. It is not \\njust government. It is government working together with people like the \\nMays to get these things done.\\n  What all of this shows, of course, is that when serious and sustained \\neffort is applied and money is invested, there is a lot of progress \\nthat we can make in dealing with things that never would have even been \\nconsidered treatable years earlier, not that many years ago, and there \\nis always more to be learned.\\n  This calls to mind something the great Thomas Edison, the inventor of \\nthe light bulb, once said: ``When you have exhausted all possibilities, \\nremember this--you haven't.'' We haven't exhausted all possibilities, \\nas Dr. Allison's path-breaking work clearly shows--not even close. We \\nhave so much more to discover and understand. With science advancing at \\npractically lightning speed, I believe it is not a question of if we \\ncure cancer but when.\\n  That comes as good news for families all across this country of ours \\nbecause almost no family has been spared. Even when we don't have a \\nclose friend or immediate family member who has undergone radiation \\ntreatment or chemotherapy, we know stories of famous people, such as \\nSteve Jobs, Aretha Franklin, and even our friend John McCain, recently \\ndeparted. They passed away from pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. For \\nothers we know, it was oral cancer or lung cancer. Cancer respects no \\npersons and observes no differences between the wealthy and the poor or \\nrace or ethnicity. But if we are lucky, we are also blessed to know \\ncancer survivors who, thanks to medical innovation, have a new shot at \\nlife. They have undergone hardships and treatment that the rest of us \\nmight find difficult to even imagine, but they have endured by their \\nspirit, and they have inspired all of us to keep working, whether it be \\nat the Mays Cancer Center in San Antonio, at MD Anderson in Houston, or \\nup here in Washington, where we work to fund research through \\nlegislation. Like Thomas Edison said, we will never exhaust all of the \\npossibilities, so we must not give up. We must keep trying.\\n  Working with generous donors, as well as undaunted scientific \\nresearchers like Dr. Allison and his team, I hope we will continue to \\napply our time and talents to finding answers and yielding newer and \\ngreater discoveries.\\n  To all the younger generations--some in towns not unlike Alice, TX--\\nto all of those who are wondering what they might want to be when they \\ngrow up, look no further than Dr. Jim Allison. Look how much he has \\naccomplished through his life's work. He is a good example of the type \\nof person you can aspire to be and what is possible if you try.\\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \\nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                             Climate Change\\n\\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something \\nthat is such an urgent challenge for our Nation and the world; that is, \\nclimate change. Over the weekend, we received the most recent and most \\ndire warning of the costs of inaction yesterday when the U.N. \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its report. It wasn't \\neasy to break through the news in the last week. We all know there was \\na lot going on, but this one did.\\n  Why did this break through the news? First of all, it was such a \\ncomprehensive report. It was a product of 91 scientists from 40 \\ncountries. They looked at more than 6,000 studies, and they concluded, \\nabsent major changes in our greenhouse gas emissions, the devastating \\nconsequences of climate change are coming much sooner than previously \\nexpected. I think that is why it made front page news--because of the \\ntimeline.\\n  I think a lot of times people think of something that maybe their \\ngrandkids or great-grandkids are going to have to deal with, but, no, \\nactually the pages in this room--young people today, people even in my \\ngeneration--are going to have to be dealing directly with the frontline \\nconsequences of climate change.\\n  The report predicted that the atmosphere will warm up by as much as \\n2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040. That is just \\nover 20 years. Think about the pages in this room. Twenty years from \\nnow might seem long, but it is not that long at all.\\n  Just 20 years ago, we could see persistent droughts--we are already \\nseeing a number of droughts now--food shortages, worsening wildfires--\\nthink of what we have already seen in Colorado and California on the \\nwest coast--and increased coastal flooding, damage that could cost $54 \\ntrillion. This is about loss of life, loss of quality of life, and this \\nis about loss of money and loss of people's incomes.\\n  As the authors of the report make clear, it will take immediate \\naction to avoid these catastrophic consequences for our country and our \\nworld. First, by 2030, we must reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 45 \\npercent from 2010 levels. Second, by 2050, we must increase our use of \\nrenewable energy, such as wind and solar, by as much as 47 percent.\\n  Do you know what? We can do this. If we don't do anything, we are \\ngoing to face dire consequences.\\n  When I first came to the Senate, we started hearing from military \\npeople and from scientists from all over the world about what we could \\nsee even in the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. So much of that has \\nalready come true. Imagine if we do nothing, and we keep on this \\ntrajectory.\\n  The American people understand it. I hear about the climate issue \\neverywhere I go in my State--from hunters in Northern Minnesota to \\npeople who like to snowmobile and cross-country ski, to business \\nleaders in the Port of Duluth, to students at the University of \\nMinnesota.\\n  Increasingly, warmer temperatures are having dramatic effects all \\nover the northern part of our country. Lyme disease has spread further \\nnorth. Aspen forests are shrinking. Moose range is declining. There is \\nthirty-seven percent more rainfall as a result of mega rainstorms than \\nwe saw 50 years ago. The ragweed pollen season has extended 3 weeks in \\nthe Twin Cities in just the past 20 years. Those are facts.\\n  When you think about the effect that has on animals, think about the \\neffect that has on our daily lives, and then think about what would \\nhappen if we kept going that way, not just this way but that way in the \\nnext 20 years. This is in stark contrast to comments made by some who \\nstill suggest the climate change debate isn't settled. I couldn't \\ndisagree more.\\n  I know we had a vote in this Chamber where something like 98 or 99 \\nSenators voted that climate change is occurring. There may not be \\nagreement on what we should do about it, but there better be soon.\\n  I am a former prosecutor, so I believe in evidence. As this U.N. \\nreport shows us, the facts and the science couldn't be clearer. I \\nsuggest that everyone read about it or read summaries, which are easily \\navailable. Every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage \\nclimate change is already causing, and Americans will feel the \\nconsequences.\\n  My State may be miles and miles away from rising oceans, but the \\nimpacts are not less of a real threat to my State. Climate change isn't \\njust about melting glaciers, although we sure have seen those. Anyone \\nwho visits Glacier National Park--I went with my family--can literally \\nsee over time, decade by decade, the changes to those glaciers. I once \\nvisited Greenland with a number of Senators, including Republican \\nSenators, and you could see what is happening there as major icebergs \\nand parts of their ice sheets are breaking off and disappearing. You \\ncan see the physical evidence of this. You can see the photographs of \\nthis. It is not just about that.\\n  Recently, we have seen the devastating impact of natural disasters, \\nlike Hurricane Florence and the catastrophic flooding this summer \\nthroughout Southern Minnesota in Duluth. There may be some political \\ndivision around climate change; that is putting it mildly. But there \\nisn't any real scientific division because nearly all of the scientists \\nin this world believe this is happening.\\n  I will never forget an episode from the John Oliver show, which is a \\nhumorous program to watch, but it brings\\n\\n[[Page S6707]]\\n\\nreal issues to light. To show that kind of scientific division, he \\ndecided to have a bunch of scientists on the stage with him. They were \\nwearing their white coats. He had something like 97 or 98 scientists on \\none side in their white coats and 1 or 2 on the other side. That is the \\ndivision. It is not real division if you are someone who believes in \\nevidence. Climate change is occurring, and this latest report is from \\nthe scientists all over the world who would have no reason to do this \\nexcept to warn people about the truth. That is why they are doing this.\\n  As citizens, we have an obligation to learn about it, to understand \\nit, and to support ideas that will not hold us back dramatically but \\nwill allow us to tackle this head-on. If we don't tackle this issue, we \\nare going to continue to struggle with the far-reaching economic and \\nenvironmental consequences. This report makes clear that those risks \\naren't far off in the future for your great-great-great-great-great-\\ngreat grandchildren; no, they could become a crisis as soon as 2040.\\n  Shifting global trends have the potential to wreak more subtle, long-\\nterm havoc on our businesses and industries. That is why so many \\nbusinesses in my State support doing something about climate change. \\nSometimes it is because they have customers all over the world--all \\nover the world in areas that are going to be the first hit by tsunamis \\nand other weather events or it is because they simply want to be good \\ncorporate citizens or it is because they see their bottom line and how \\nit is going to be affected if we don't do something about this.\\n  The U.N. report details the economic damage that will happen if we \\nfail to act, including losses of roughly 1.2 percent to our gross \\ndomestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warning. As it gets hotter, \\nthe GDP does go down.\\n  As a Senator from a State with a strong agricultural industry and a \\ntradition of hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and skiing, climate change \\nis not only a direct threat to our State's economy, it is also a threat \\nto our quality of life, to the way we grew up, to enjoying the outdoors \\nwith our friends and our families.\\n  When President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw \\nfrom the international climate change agreement last summer, I heard a \\nlot from people in our State.\\n  As you all know, 195 countries made a pledge to come together to \\ncombat climate change, and in withdrawing, the United States was \\ninitially one of only three countries that would not be in the \\nagreement. The other two countries that weren't in the agreement were \\nSyria and Nicaragua. Well, now Syria and Nicaragua have signed the \\naccord, so the United States is now the only country not to sign the \\naccord.\\n  Our decision to leave this agreement sent the wrong message to the \\nrest of the world--the wrong message. The lack of leadership has led to \\nother countries discussing backing out of the agreement. That is not \\nleadership. That is not leading from the front. We can't have this \\nhappen. America should be leading and helping the world move forward.\\n  By the way, there is such an innovation space here, so much money to \\nbe made by responding to this in a smart way and developing new \\nvehicles and developing new energy and new ways to deal with this \\nchallenge. It isn't just a challenge; it is also an opportunity. If we \\ndon't seize that opportunity by getting our own act together, by \\nadmitting that it is a problem and giving incentives to our businesses \\nto go in the right direction and to bring other countries with us, we \\nare going to lose that opportunity to other countries that are part of \\nthis international coalition.\\n  I have already talked to people who work in government or who work \\nfor businesses that have gone to international meetings and who have \\nsaid: Do you know what some of these people in other countries say? I \\nthink we are going to work with China on this. They are part of that \\nagreement. Hey, we are going to buy our solar panels from them, or we \\nare going to do work with them on this.\\n  You can't hide from the fact that we withdrew from that agreement, \\nand it hurts not just our environment, it hurts our economic \\nopportunities going forward.\\n  Look at Minnesota and what has happened because we were out front on \\nthis. I am proud that our State has taken an incredibly proactive and \\ninnovative approach to energy use and sustainability, which is critical \\nto addressing carbon emissions. Our State's renewable energy standard \\nrequires that 25 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources \\nby 2025. We passed that way back in 2007 with--get this--a Republican \\nGovernor, Governor Pawlenty. He helped lead the way on that and worked \\nwith the legislature of Democrats and Republicans to pass what was at \\nthe time seen as a very aggressive standard. We did it by combining it \\nwith doing something about biofuels--something that is important not \\njust in Minnesota but in the Presiding Officer's State of North Dakota.\\n  We were able to put together that kind of coalition--the leaders in \\nour legislature and the Governor, farmers and workers, \\nenvironmentalists--to move forward on biofuels so we would have \\ndiversity in our fuel supply as well as diversity in our energy supply. \\nSo we don't rely on just one type of energy, and we reduce greenhouse \\ngases by having an ``all of the above'' energy approach.\\n  The legislation back then in 2007 received overwhelming bipartisan \\nsupport, passing the Minnesota House 123 to 10 and the Minnesota Senate \\n63 to 3. It has been a while since we have reached that kind of \\nconsensus on the Federal level when it comes to energy.\\n  What has happened? We have more than met those goals. What has \\nhappened nationally? Well, there was progress made during the Obama \\nadministration. When I first got here in 2007, I personally thought \\nthat we should move to some kind of a renewable electricity standard \\nfor the whole country, maybe making differences by geographic areas and \\nregions. Sadly, the decision was not made to go that way. I think we \\nlost it by one vote. We lost it by one vote. Instead, the decision was \\nmade on one side that we wanted to be more aggressive--and we tried \\nwith cap and trade, but that didn't end up getting passed in the \\nSenate--and then on the other side, to kind of say: Well, let's just \\nsee what happens. As a result, in my mind, we have not done nearly \\nenough.\\n  What has happened instead? Well, the States, our laboratories of \\ndemocracy, have moved ahead--many of them, like Minnesota--and are \\ncoming up with their own standards or doing it by region. Our \\nuniversities have moved ahead, our cities have moved ahead, and our \\nbusinesses have moved ahead. By 2015, 154 companies, including \\ncompanies I am very proud of--major companies in my State, such as \\nTarget, Best Buy, General Mills, and Cargill--had signed a pledge \\ndemonstrating their support for action on climate change that takes a \\nstrong step toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. These companies \\ncollectively employ more than 9 million people and represent more than \\n$3 trillion in annual revenue.\\n  Last month at the Alliance to Save Energy gala, I got to present an \\nEnergy Efficiency Award to Target because of the work they have done \\nwith sustainability and righting the impacts of climate change. They \\nhave created an electric car program that is up and running in 5 \\nStates, and they plan to expand that number to 20 in the next 2 years. \\nThey signed a virtual power purchase agreement with the Stephens Ranch \\nwind farm in Texas as part of their goal of sourcing 100 percent \\nrenewable energy in their U.S. operations. Like so many companies in \\nthe United States, they have started a major solar program and are \\ncommitted to establishing rooftop solar panels on 500 of their stores \\nby 2020. As of last year, they had already finished 436 of their \\nprojects.\\n  They are not alone. Xcel Energy, Minnesota's largest utility, was an \\nearly supporter of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.\\n  If we had allowed that to go through and had that in place, imagine \\nwhat a better position we would be in when we read headlines like those \\nfrom this morning about the U.N.'s report and the dire predictions of \\nwhat we are going to see in 20 years. But, no, we are in what I \\nconsider a state of paralysis. Maybe we are not making things worse, \\nalthough when we took away those gas mileage standards--when the \\nadministration went back on that--we made them worse. We sure aren't \\nmaking them better. Thanks to cities and\\n\\n[[Page S6708]]\\n\\nStates, we are making progress, but we should be doing this together as \\na nation.\\n  Xcel Energy is another example of a company that appears to be ahead \\nof the Federal Government. They supported the Obama administration's \\nClean Power Plan and announced plans to reduce carbon emissions by 60 \\npercent in the next 15 years.\\n  I look at it this way: If companies like Target and Xcel Energy \\nunderstand the need to reduce our use of fossil fuels and embrace the \\nenergy of the future, then so should Members of Congress, and so should \\nthis administration.\\n  We know that energy innovation can't take root--not in any serious \\nway--without certainty and stability on what those incentives are. That \\nis what that Clean Power Plan was about. It took what I considered a \\nmore moderate route than some people thought it was going to take, but \\nthen it got pulled back by this administration. It is very hard to \\nstart planning for the future if we don't have a route for these \\ncompanies to go. The rest of the world is getting on board. We don't \\nwant to be following; we want to be leading in America.\\n\\n  As this week's report made clear, inaction is not an option for our \\neconomy, for our environment, for our country, or for the world. \\nMilitary and security experts have repeatedly reminded us that climate \\nchange is a threat to our national security, increasing risks of \\nconflict, humanitarian crisis, and damage to critical infrastructure.\\n  We see the stories of some of the refugees who are not coming up from \\nconflict but are coming up from parts of Africa where they used to do \\nsubsistence farming but can no longer do that kind of subsistence \\nfarming because it is too dry, there are too many droughts, and the \\nworld has changed. We are going to see these humongous movements of \\npeople because they can't live where they used to live.\\n  It is much better for us if we take this on as a world and do \\nsomething about it than deal with the repercussions of it--more severe \\nweather, heat waves that could reduce our water supply, extreme \\nrainfall that could damage critical infrastructure, and a decrease in \\nagricultural productivity that could threaten my State's $20 billion \\nagricultural industry. People around the country understand the stakes, \\nbut this place--I think it needs just a little more imagination.\\n  If you ever visit my office, I have a picture on the wall, and it is \\na picture of an angel, and she is handing off the world to some \\noutstretched hands. The words on the picture read: ``The angel \\nshrugged, and she said, `If we fail this time, it will be a failure of \\nimagination.' '' That is what we need right now in Washington, DC--\\nimagination to deal with a very clear threat that the scientists have \\nput right in front of us. Twenty years from now, it is going to be \\nworse than those wildfires we see raging in California and Colorado. \\nTwenty years from now, it is going to be worse than what we are seeing \\nwhen it comes to the hurricanes and the tsunamis and all of the \\nicebergs melting and what we are seeing in our national parks. Why \\nwould we just let this happen? We are America. We are leaders. It is \\ntime to act.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \\nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\\n\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\\n\\n\\n                               Healthcare\\n\\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, now that the Senate has concluded \\nits very divisive debate about the Supreme Court, it is time to talk \\nabout the No. 1 issue to the American people: healthcare. We begin that \\ndebate tomorrow, when the Senate will take up a Democratic motion to \\nrepeal the Trump administration's effort to expand short-term insurance \\nplans.\\n  Let me be clear. These so-called short-term plans are junk insurance. \\nShort-term plans are junk insurance. People who buy them are going to \\nbe extremely disappointed because they bait the consumer in with low \\nprices but hardly cover anything. They might not cover maternity care, \\nmental health care, prescription drugs--you name it. Even worse, the \\nplans draw consumers out of the health insurance market, making it more \\nexpensive for everyone else to purchase insurance, especially more \\nexpensive for those with preexisting conditions.\\n  That is why so many prominent patient and consumer groups have filed \\na lawsuit against the administration's rule to expand these junk plans. \\nGroups like the American Cancer Society, the AARP, the Lung \\nAssociation, the Diabetes Association, and others that represent \\nmillions of Americans with preexisting conditions have clearly said \\nthat this is sabotage--sabotage--of the insurance market and will drive \\nup costs for millions of Americans.\\n  So Senator Baldwin has introduced a CRA disapproval resolution--a \\nresolution brought under the Congressional Review Act--to repeal this \\nfundamentally misguided policy from the Trump administration. All of my \\ncolleagues should vote for this, but I suspect my colleagues on the \\nother side of the aisle have a different idea because ever since taking \\ncontrol of Congress and the Presidency, Republicans have deliberately, \\nrelentlessly undermined Americans' healthcare.\\n  This particular policy is part of a long campaign to sabotage our \\nhealthcare system. Remember, nearly every Republican was silent when \\nPresident Trump canceled the program that helped low-income Americans \\nafford insurance. Remember, every Republican was silent when President \\nTrump directed his administration to stop helping Americans sign up for \\nthe right policy. Remember, nearly every Republican was silent when \\nPresident Trump's Justice Department refused to defend protections for \\npreexisting conditions. A large number of Republican attorneys \\ngeneral--some running for the Senate right now--were part of the Trump \\nadministration's efforts to say it is just fine to get rid of \\nprotections for those with preexisting conditions. Remember, nearly \\nevery Republican voted to gut Medicaid, raise premiums on older \\nAmericans, repeal protections for Americans with preexisting \\nconditions, and move us toward a future where 20 million fewer \\nAmericans have healthcare. Remember, every single Republican voted to \\nrepeal the coverage requirement and cause premiums to be much higher \\nthis year than they needed to be.\\n\\n  So Americans, when you are paying more for insurance and you hate it, \\nwhen those deductibles go up, those copayments go up, and you say: \\nWhere is the insurance that was supposed to protect me? I have taken so \\nmuch money out of my own pocket. It is hardly worth it. Look to the \\nother side of the aisle, and look at what your Senators have done, if \\nyou come from a State where they represent you. As a result of the \\nRepublican sabotage, premiums are up, out-of-pocket costs are up, \\nprescription drug costs are up, and the quality of insurance is down--\\nin many cases way down. Under this Republican President and this \\nRepublican Congress, Americans are paying more to get lower quality \\nhealth insurance. Americans, under this President, this Congress, are \\npaying more to get less when it comes to health insurance.\\n  Protections for preexisting conditions are under assault in so many \\ndifferent ways. No wonder why, in poll after poll, Americans put \\nhealthcare as the No. 1 issue in the upcoming election. Tomorrow the \\nSenate will have an opportunity to undo a portion of the Republican \\ncampaign to sabotage healthcare.\\n  In November, the American people will have a golden opportunity to \\nmove our country in a dramatically different direction by voting for \\nDemocratic candidates who will work to improve our healthcare rather \\nthan so many of those Republican candidates who, in obeisance to the \\nbig insurance companies, work to destroy it.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Arkansas.\\n\\n\\n                                S. 3021\\n\\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Barrasso, \\nRanking Member Carper, and Senators Inhofe and Cardin for all their \\nhard work to advance the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 to \\nthe Senate\\n\\n[[Page S6709]]\\n\\nfloor so we can make the much needed improvements to our Nation's water \\ninfrastructure. I would also like to express my appreciation to the \\nhard-working staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee who \\nspent literally countless hours working on this important water \\ninfrastructure legislation. The path to getting this bill to the Senate \\nfloor has not been easy, and it would not have happened without the \\nstrong bipartisanship shown by EPW leaders.\\n  This bill gets us back on track to authorize critical water \\ninfrastructure projects across the country every 2 years, ensuring our \\neconomic vitality and competitiveness. America's Water Infrastructure \\nAct is in lockstep with President Trump's vision for infrastructure by \\ngrowing our economy, cutting redtape, protecting our citizens and their \\nproperty, and improving transparency, all the while being fiscally \\nresponsible.\\n  I am particularly pleased, this bill also includes the Securing \\nRequired Funding for Water Infrastructure Now Act or SRF WIN Act \\nlegislation that I had an opportunity to introduce with Senator Booker. \\nThe SRF WIN Act was a truly bipartisan effort, and I would like to give \\nspecial thanks to our cosponsors, Senators Barrasso, Cornyn, Inhofe, \\nCapito, Wicker, Hyde-Smith, Feinstein, Casey, Baldwin, Manchin, and \\nSenator Whitehouse.\\n  The fact that the SRF WIN Act has cosponsors from across the country \\nwith vastly different political ideologies makes an important point \\nthat infrastructure investment is not a rural issue or a big city \\nissue. It is not a red State or blue State problem. This is a national \\nemergency, and it is time we put partisanship aside and show the \\nAmerican people we can work together to provide safe and reliable \\ndrinking water and wastewater services to Americans in every part of \\nthe country.\\n  The SRF WIN Act is a result of months-long negotiations. It blends \\nthe best ideas available to ensure this commonsense, bipartisan \\nlegislation will work effectively and efficiently, providing millions \\nand potentially billions in project dollars to communities that have \\ntraditionally not had access to these types of funds.\\n  What the SRF WIN Act does is simple. It combines the efficiency and \\ntrust associated with the State Revolving Funds with the leveraging \\npower of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. This \\nlegislation makes the process easier and more affordable for States and \\ncommunities to access Federal water infrastructure funding. Simply put, \\nthe SRF WIN Act is a critical component to future water infrastructure \\nfinancing.\\n  Congress needs to do a better job providing basic public services \\nsuch as safe roads, bridges, and an up-to-date water infrastructure \\nsystem. By passing America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, Congress \\nhas made water infrastructure investment a top priority. This bill is a \\nvictory for job creators, small and large businesses, every single \\nState across the country, and consumers. I am pleased to see support \\nfor this bill in the House, the Senate, and the White House.\\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation, and I again \\nthank Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, Senators Inhofe and \\nCardin for their strong bipartisan work. They set a great example of \\nthe good policy outcomes that can be accomplished if we work together.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                               Healthcare\\n\\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we receive a lot of letters in our \\noffices, and primarily we pay attention to those that come from our own \\nhome States. People expect me as their Senator to read the letter and \\nto at least consider their point of view. Some of these letters are \\nkind of routine, almost form letters. Some emails come in at a volume \\nwe can hardly keep up with. In Illinois, I receive 10,000 emails a \\nweek--a week. That is a lot.\\n  There was a time when I was a college kid working here on Capitol \\nHill, and the Senator from Illinois signed every letter that went out \\nof the office--sat at the desk and signed the letters. It is \\ninconceivable now that we can respond to all the letters each day. We \\ntry to keep up with them, we try to be timely, and we pick those \\nletters out that are personal and important enough that the staff \\nthinks I should read them personally, and I make a point of doing it.\\n  Sometimes the stories they tell give me an insight into the issues we \\ndebate on the floor of the Senate.\\n  Most of the time the American people look at us puzzled, asking: What \\nare they talking about, and why does this mean anything to my family \\nand my future?\\n  Let me give you an example of a couple of letters I received that \\nrelate to a vote we are going to take this week. The first letter was \\nfrom Richard and Mary Laidman, from Naperville, IL, which is west of \\nthe city of Chicago, in DuPage County.\\n  Richard and Mary wrote: ``Our 13-year-old son Sam was diagnosed with \\nleukemia one day after the `no pre-existing conditions exclusions for \\nkids' protection went into effect.''\\n  They went on to say to me: ``Obviously, we are feeling dependent on \\nall the clauses of the [ACA] right now--including [the] no pre-existing \\nconditions exclusions.''\\n  The bottom line, the Laidmans say, is ``junk insurance plans,'' the \\nones that are so cheap they don't cover anything important. ``Junk \\ninsurance plans'' wouldn't cover their son. It would leave him and the \\nfamily to fend for themselves in the individual market.\\n  Do you know what it is like to go into the individual market as a \\nmother and father and try to find health insurance for a 13-year-old \\nson who has been diagnosed with leukemia? Maybe you can't find any, but \\nif you could, it would be so expensive that you might not be able to \\nafford it. The Affordable Care Act changed that, and it said: If you \\nare going to offer health insurance plans in this country, you cannot \\ndiscriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions. You have to \\ncover everybody--bring them all in.\\n  We do that in Medicare. We say when you reach Medicare eligibility: \\nAll aboard. Everybody is invited in.\\n  But for the longest time, private health insurance companies wanted \\nto pick and choose. They wanted healthy people who can pay premiums. \\nThey would rather not pay these bills so they excluded a lot of people \\nwith preexisting conditions.\\n  Sam, age 13 and diagnosed with leukemia, would be one of the victims \\nof that old-time approach. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society recently \\nstated:\\n\\n       People diagnosed with cancer on a short term plan soon \\n     discover these plans fail to cover even lifesaving cancer \\n     treatments. If patients on short term plans can get access to \\n     cancer therapies at all, they will often be left with \\n     hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.\\n\\n  Tammy Baldwin is a Senator from the State of Wisconsin. She is going \\nto offer to the Senate tomorrow a chance to vote against President \\nTrump's plan that would eliminate protection for preexisting \\nconditions. We will get a chance to be on record here. I think it is \\nlong overdue.\\n  None of us knows what tomorrow will bring. We don't know if tomorrow \\nwill bring an accident or a diagnosis, and, all of a sudden, your \\nhappy, healthy family has a challenge you never dreamed of. It has \\nhappened to my family. I will bet it has happened to most of yours.\\n  The question is, Are we going to demand of health insurance companies \\nthat they cover those with preexisting conditions or are we just going \\nto tell those families: Fend for yourself. See what happens. See how \\nmuch it costs.\\n  Another letter is from Watseka, IL, from the McTaggart family. \\nWatseka is south of Chicago, in Iroquois County, a rural county, with \\nbig towns like Watseka and Milford. It is a great little place.\\n  Here is a letter from Christine McTaggart. She was originally \\ndiagnosed with stage III inflammatory breast cancer. Given this type of \\naggressive cancer, her prognosis was not\\n\\n[[Page S6710]]\\n\\ngood. She went through 16 cycles of chemo, a bilateral mastectomy, 33 \\nradiation treatments, failed reconstruction and chronic tissue issues, \\nand a thyroid cancer diagnosis. After all that, she learned the breast \\ncancer was back. This time she was stage IV. In her letter to me, \\nChristine said:\\n\\n       When the ACA became law, I had no idea that my life would \\n     come to depend on policies such as pre-existing conditions \\n     not excluding you from coverage.\\n\\n  She ends with this quote:\\n\\n       I thank you for your tireless advocacy on this issue. . . . \\n     My life, literally, depends on it.\\n\\n  We pass a lot of resolutions here for ``National Pickle Week'' and \\nsaluting the flag. All of that is part of my job. Occasionally, an \\nissue comes to the floor of the Senate that is really going to affect \\nlife-and-death issues for Americans all across our Nation. This is one \\nof them. This is the No. 1 issue in this election.\\n  You might think our debate last week about a Supreme Court Justice \\nwas important, but you ask families back in Illinois: What do you \\nreally care about?\\n  They say: Senator, that was an important debate. I care about my \\nfamily. I care about my health insurance. I want to make sure of two \\nthings. I want to make sure I can afford it, and I want to make sure \\nthat when I buy it, it is worth owning and it is there when I need it.\\n  The Republican view on this is this: Buyer beware. Go out in the \\nmarketplace. Shop around. Buy yourself something cheap, like a junk \\ninsurance plan. It may not be there when you need it, but boy, the \\npremiums will be low.\\n  That is not much confidence in insurance, if that is the case, and \\nthat is why, when Tammy Baldwin, Senator of Wisconsin, offers us a \\nchance to vote--I think, as soon as tomorrow--on this Trump rule, I \\nhope we will get at least two Republicans who cross the aisle and join \\nus. If they are listening at home, they will, because if they are \\nlistening at home, they know that families really care about this issue \\nof preexisting conditions. It is so important for us.\\n  You look at the groups that have come out in opposition to President \\nTrump's junk insurance plans. They are the most important groups that \\nyou could think of. The American Cancer Society stated that President \\nTrump's junk plan rule would ``leave older and sicker Americans in the \\nindividual market with few, if any, affordable health coverage \\nchoices'' and that ``patients living with serious conditions will be \\nleft paying more for the coverage they need, if they can afford \\ncoverage at all.\\n  In recent months, I have heard a lot of congressional Republicans \\nproclaim to care about people with preexisting conditions, especially \\nthose up for reelection. These are the same ones who have eagerly voted \\nto repeal the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the night.\\n  I have been in the Senate for a few years. That was one vote I will \\nnever forget. John McCain walked through those doors in the middle of \\nthe night, stood at that table, and with his arms still restricted \\nbecause of the torture he went through as a veteran in the Vietnam war, \\nhe could barely lift his right arm with his thumb pointed down, saying \\nno. That ``no'' vote, together with two other Republicans, saved health \\ninsurance coverage for millions of Americans.\\n  But the Trump administration isn't finished. They found new ways to \\nreduce coverage for American families and to raise costs. That is what \\nthe Trump plan is all about, and that is what we get a chance to vote \\non.\\n  The Senate is broken out in 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. If all \\nof the Democrats vote for Tammy Baldwin, and I think they will, we \\nstill need two Republicans. Let's see if they will come over and vote \\nnot only against the Trump plan but vote for the millions of families \\nlike those who I have read about today on the floor who are counting on \\nquality health insurance to be there when they need it, who believe \\nthat no one should discriminate against someone because of a \\npreexisting health condition. That, to me, seems fundamentally fair.\\n  I have raised a child with a serious problem. We face this time and \\nagain. Nobody should have to face it. A vote for Tammy Baldwin's \\nresolution of disapproval on the Trump plan tomorrow will put America \\non the right course for families that need health insurance they can \\ncount on.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                                S. 3021\\n\\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Water Resources \\nDevelopment Act, the cloture motion of which we will be voting on very \\nshortly. I strongly support moving forward with this legislation, and I \\nencourage this body's support of that important work.\\n  I begin by thanking Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and \\nSenator Inhofe for their great work on this bill. On the Environment \\nand Public Works Committee, we have the leadership of Senator Barrasso \\nand Senator Carper, and on the subcommittee that deals with \\ninfrastructure, I work with Senator Inhofe. The four of us have worked \\nvery closely in, I think, the best traditions of the Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee in the U.S. Senate in order to bring forward \\nlegislation that really does represent the priorities of all 100 \\nMembers of the U.S. Senate.\\n  From the beginning, I acknowledge the amount of work that was done in \\norder to accomplish this. It was done in great measure by incredibly \\ngifted staff people who have been working for a long period of time in \\norder to bring this bill to completion. Obviously, there are rough \\nedges, and there are problems that require a lot of negotiations. Yet I \\nknow that Senator Barrasso, Senator Carper, and Senator Inhofe will \\nagree with me about the importance of our staffs' work.\\n  I acknowledge Mae Stevens of my staff for the work she has done on \\nthis legislation to advance the priorities that are important for the \\npeople of Maryland and to make sure we have a well-balanced bill for \\nour country.\\n  As I think my colleagues know, the focal point of my environmental \\nwork has been to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay, which is \\nconsidered to be one of America's greatest natural resources and is a \\nnational treasure. The Chesapeake Bay is the Nation's largest estuary. \\nIt generates $1 trillion in economic benefit to the watershed region. \\nThe Chesapeake Bay is critically important with regard to who we are as \\na region, our quality of life, our economy, and because of its rich \\nenvironmental treasures.\\n  The shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries stretch \\nover 2,000 miles. More than 100,000 streams and rivers and thousands of \\nacres of wetlands provide the freshwater that flows into the Chesapeake \\nBay. If we do not protect the health of this incredible network of \\nwaters, we cannot hope to restore the Chesapeake Bay to its former \\nglory.\\n  Additionally, the effort to clean up and restore the bay creates new \\njobs and economic growth opportunities around the bay States. For \\nexample, work to repair and upgrade our urban and suburban wastewater \\nand stormwater systems puts people to work as engineers and operators, \\nand there are so many more jobs that are created.\\n  Although we are making great strides in improving the quality of the \\nChesapeake Bay--I am very pleased of the progress we have made, and I \\nthink you see that when you visit the Inner Harbor of Baltimore or our \\nshorelines--we still have a long way to go.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 supports the health of the \\nChesapeake Bay. In doing so, it helps our Nation's economic \\ncompetitiveness, our environment, and the health and welfare of our \\ncitizens. In particular, I am pleased that America's Water \\nInfrastructure Act of 2018 will help both Poplar Island and the Mid-Bay \\nproject to continue what is a win-win for both the Baltimore Harbor and \\nthe Chesapeake Bay. Both of these projects are located in the State of \\nMaryland. Both are critically important for us to maintain the \\nenvironment and economy of the Chesapeake Bay.\\n\\n[[Page S6711]]\\n\\n  I have seen firsthand the results of the U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers' efforts around the State. The Corps' ingenuity and expertise \\nhave spearheaded the replenishing and expansion of Poplar Island in the \\nChesapeake Bay. This massive sustainability project is quite literally \\nbringing life to our region in its restoration of a habitat which for \\nyears suffered from erosion and environmental degradation.\\n  We are taking Poplar Island, which used to exist in the Chesapeake \\nBay but had been down to just a few acres, and restoring it in an \\nenvironmental restoration project. We are bringing back wildlife and \\nspecies diversification into the Chesapeake Bay. At the same time, it \\nis a location for dredged materials. I can tell you, in my having been \\nin Congress, it is not always easy to find locations to put dredged \\nmaterials. Poplar Island is also popular with the community, so it has \\nbeen a win-win-win situation.\\n  The expansion of the island now to 1,715 acres has the long-term \\nbenefit of creating a place for our native plants and animals to thrive \\nand the short-term benefit of efficiently utilizing dredged materials \\nfrom the maintenance of the Port of Baltimore to rebuild the island \\nbeyond its original footprint. We are now back up to over 1,700 acres \\nfrom just the few acres that existed not too many years ago. This \\ncreates a system that helps to improve the vitality of both our \\ntreasured ecosystem and our commercial waterways, and it sets a \\nprecedent for beneficial practices in the future.\\n  The Army Corps has collaborated with Federal and State agencies, \\nlocal communities, and businesses for input on this project, ensuring \\nthat its benefits will extend to all within the region.\\n  The Mid-Bay Project is a continuation of the very successful Poplar \\nIsland project, and I am pleased that both projects are supported in \\nthis bill. Poplar Island will reach its capacity in the next few years, \\nwhich is what we planned on. Yet, in order to make sure we have another \\nsite that is available, we have to move that project now so that the \\nplanning process can be completed in time and engineering work can be \\ncompleted in time so that there is no loss of activity in keeping the \\nharbors at the needed dredge levels for shipping and have a site where \\nthe dredged material can be located. That is why it is so critically \\nimportant to move forward with Mid-Bay now.\\n\\n  We need policies that will keep up with the demand of our \\ninfrastructure backlog while we address the needs of our communities \\nand our environment. We can and we must do both. I am pleased that \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 would help projects in the \\nAnacostia River watershed in Prince George's County get off the ground.\\n  This is the third WRDA bill in a row. Congress is including updates \\nto our Nation's drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater \\ninfrastructure, including much needed funding.\\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has yet again given our \\ndrinking water and wastewater a grade of D for 2016. States will need \\n$32.75 billion a year every year for the next 20 years just to get our \\ninfrastructure in working order, which is more than $1 trillion. Yet we \\nare currently only spending about $2 billion per year on both the clean \\nwater and drinking water State revolving funds combined. Every \\ncommunity--urban, rural, and suburban neighborhoods--has a right to \\nexpect that water that comes from its tap is safe to drink and that \\nCongress will do everything within its power to ensure that it happens. \\nClean water means good jobs and better health throughout Maryland and \\nour Nation.\\n  Clean water is not a partisan issue, and I have been proud to work \\nwith my colleagues to develop legislation that will benefit our aging \\nwater resources and infrastructure. Congress has the responsibility to \\nbe a strong partner with States and localities to repair our Nation's \\nhidden water infrastructure and open waterways and to always remain \\nunwavering in our commitment to improve the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\\n  One of the problems is that a lot of our water infrastructure is \\nhidden. You don't see it, but you sure do notice it if you don't get \\nclean water to drink, and you sure notice it when it affects the water \\nquality of the bay or of other critical waters in this country. We \\nreally need to pay attention to this. We need to increase our capacity \\nto be a partner in modernizing our water infrastructure, and this \\nlegislation absolutely takes a major step forward in carrying out that \\ncommitment.\\n  Let me talk about some of the specific provisions that are included \\nin this act.\\n  First, the bill includes S. 1137, the Clean Safe Reliable Water \\nInfrastructure Act, which was introduced by me and Senators Boozman, \\nInhofe, and Duckworth. It addresses the need to invest in our Nation's \\ndrinking water, sewer, and stormwater systems, and it provides for \\nincreased water efficiency.\\n  The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act specifically \\nincludes $450 million to protect the sources of our drinking water and \\nthe funding to repair and eliminate combined sewer overflows, which \\ndump water sewage into our Nation's waterways every time it rains. This \\nis especially timely as the Mid-Atlantic region has seen historic \\nprecipitation events increasingly in the last decade. These 100- or \\n1,000-year events cause wastewater treatment plants to take on more \\nwater than they can handle. Millions of gallons of untreated water are \\ndiverted into our local waterways--the same water that supplies our \\ndrinking water and the fish, crabs, and oysters that Marylanders love \\nto eat.\\n  In fact, there was a storm so massive in Frederick, MD, just a few \\nmonths ago that city officials asked residents to stop using the water \\nin order to prevent equipment failure at the wastewater treatment \\nplant. This is a crisis situation. This $450 million will go far toward \\nhelping to divert stormwater away from the wastewater treatment plant \\nin Frederick as well as those like it all over the State of Maryland \\nand our Nation.\\n  The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act also formally \\nauthorizes the voluntary WaterSense Program, which identifies and \\npromotes water-efficient products through voluntary labeling. The \\nWaterSense label makes it simple to find water-efficient products, new \\nhomes, and programs that meet the EPA's criteria for efficiency and \\nperformance. WaterSense-labeled products and services are certified to \\nuse at least 20-percent less water, save energy, and perform as well as \\nor better than regular models. The program should help individuals \\nreduce their water demand while protecting water quality. This benefits \\nall of us, as we save water, we save energy, and we save costs.\\n  The EPA's WaterSense Program partners with manufacturers, retailers, \\ndistributors, home builders, irrigation professionals, and utilities to \\nbring efficient products and services to our communities, and their \\npartnerships encourage innovation in manufacturing and support \\nsustainable jobs for American workers.\\n  Secondly, the WRDA bill creates a multi-agency Federal task force to \\nstudy the problem of funding and financing stormwater infrastructure. \\nThe task force will, with the feedback from State and local governments \\nand other program stakeholders, provide in a report to Congress \\nsuggestions for improving the funding and financing of stormwater \\nsystems--especially important as Maryland sees more frequent and severe \\nstorms, like the deadly floods in Ellicott City that were 22 months \\napart.\\n  I have already spoken on the Senate floor about what happened in \\nEllicott City, MD. Within 20 months, we had two 1,000-year floods. \\nThese floods were unprecedented. What do I mean by that? We have had \\nflooding in Ellicott City before because the water rises in the river \\nthat goes through Ellicott City. These are the first floods we have had \\nas a result of the stormwater runoff that literally ran down the main \\nstreets of Ellicott City. It destroyed homes and cost people their \\nlives.\\n  We need to deal with this. Stormwater pollution is not only an urgent \\nand deadly threat but a long-term one as well. Stormwater pollution is \\nthe fastest growing source of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. Yes, we \\ntalk about our farmers, and we have to do better for our farmers. We \\ntalk about the other problems we have, including the airborne \\npollutants that go into the Bay. But the fastest growing source in the \\nChesapeake Bay is storm runoff, which is a result of more people\\n\\n[[Page S6712]]\\n\\nliving in the community, a result of more concrete, and a result of \\nmore severe weather events.\\n  Third, the bill addresses the need for information about onsite \\nwastewater recycling as one alternative for communities that cannot \\nafford the upfront costs or ongoing maintenance costs of traditional \\nwastewater infrastructure. This is especially important in the rural \\nparts of my State, like Maryland's Eastern Shore.\\n  Fourth, the bill includes S. 451, the Water Resources Research \\nAmendments Act, introduced by me and Senator Boozman, which addresses \\nthe need for additional research into increasing the effectiveness and \\nefficiency of new and existing water treatment works. Funding from this \\nprogram helps to support the Maryland Water Resources Research Center \\nand the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the \\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park. We want to add the latest \\ntechnology. We want to be the best in the world, as far as technology, \\nwhen dealing with our water. This particular provision in the bill will \\nhelp us achieve those objectives.\\n  Fifth, the bill reauthorizes WIFIA, a low-cost financing mechanism \\nfor water infrastructure projects. We first started with WIFIA in our \\ntransportation bill, coming out of our Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee, where we found creative ways in order to leverage the \\nFederal participation so we can have larger infrastructure projects for \\nroads, transit, and bridges. Now we are doing the same with water \\ninfrastructure. This bill reauthorizes the WIFIA program.\\n  Baltimore is on the list to receive one of the very first low-\\ninterest WIFIA loans. Baltimore's $200 million loan will complete a set \\nof projects to repair, rehabilitate, replace, and upgrade its \\nwastewater collection and treatment, water treatment and distribution, \\nand storm water management systems.\\n  These projects will help to improve the city's sanitary sewer \\ncollection system, ensure the reliability and performance of the \\ndrinking water and wastewater systems, and improve storm water \\nmanagement to meet Clean Water Act permit requirements.\\n  This will help the 1.8 million people served by the Baltimore \\nDepartment of Public Works to continue to have some of the cleanest, \\nsafest, and most reliable drinking water in the country. There is no \\nmore fundamental responsibility of government than to make sure they \\nprovide safe drinking water to its population.\\n  Sixth, this bill creates the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and \\nSustainability Program, from a bill that I have long championed to help \\ndrinking water plants combat the effects of climate change. This \\nprogram will award grants to increase the resiliency and adaptability \\nof water systems to increasingly severe storms and droughts, as well as \\nsea level rise--all caused by climate change.\\n  Water utilities can use the grants to assist in the planning, design, \\nconstruction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of the plant--\\nreally, anything they need to increase their climate preparedness.\\n  I applaud the great work that has been accomplished through this \\nlegislation, and I look forward to continuing the work to advance water \\ninfrastructure investment, including integrated planning and \\naffordability.\\n  From the very beginning, I said that this was a bill that was done in \\nthe right process in the Senate. Input was solicited from every Member \\nof the Senate. The committee reached out to all of the Members. All the \\nmembers of our committee have had input into this legislation. It is \\nbipartisan. It is fiscally responsible, which was a key requirement of \\nthe bill.\\n  It will benefit of our communities. It will help us to meet our \\nfundamental commitment to provide the citizens of this Nation with \\nclean and safe drinking water. It will deal with the challenges we have \\nin storm runoff, as it deals with environmental challenges we have. It \\nis a well-balanced bill.\\n  Once again, I applaud the leadership of Senators Barrasso and Carper \\nand my colleague on the subcommittee, Senator Inhofe, for their \\ntremendous work.\\n  I look forward to voting for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \\ndo the same.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\\n\\n\\n                    Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\\n\\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on two \\ndifferent subjects. The most important one is the first one: to thank a \\nlot of people who helped me to chair and oversee the confirmation of \\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh.\\n  I should have given this speech 72 hours ago, but I was in a hurry to \\nget to the airport. So I am making up for lost time now.\\n  As everyone knows, on Saturday the Senate confirmed Judge Brett \\nKavanaugh as our newest Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I \\ncome to the floor to thank the Senate staff who helped to make that \\nconfirmation possible.\\n  Senators don't always recognize their staff as much as we probably \\nshould, but I am proud of the work my staff accomplished over the last \\n3 months as we considered the nomination of Kavanaugh. They have worked \\nvery diligently on this confirmation process of our new Justice, and \\nmost of it was behind the scenes. They put in the long, long work hours \\nrequired, and they did it 7 days a week, if needed. The chairman's team \\ntackled the heavy workload before them, and I am tremendously grateful \\nfor all they did to make this nomination a success.\\n  First, on my staff, I would like to recognize my Judiciary counsel \\nstaff director, Kolan Davis. Kolan's experience and sound judgment \\nkeeps me out of a lot of trouble. I value his counsel today, just as I \\nhave for the last 33 years that he has been on my staff.\\n  By my side right here today is Mike Davis, the Judiciary Committee's \\nchief counsel for nominations and also an Iowan. He graduated from the \\nUniversity of Iowa and Iowa Law. Mike brought the tenacity, diligence, \\nand everything else that was needed to lead Kavanaugh's confirmation.\\n  The permanent nomination unit for the Senate Judiciary Committee, \\nworking with Mike Davis, includes Lauren Mehler, Steve Kenny, Katharine \\nWilley, and Jessica Vu. Each of them worked incredibly hard. They have \\nworked hard on all nominations of lifetime appointments to the Federal \\njudiciary and over a long period of time, not just on Kavanaugh. Their \\nhard work is shown by the record number of judges the Senate has \\nconfirmed this Congress. I think the number is 67 so far, besides 2 \\nSupreme Court Justices. I believe there are 41 on the calendar right \\nnow.\\n  In addition to this team, Andrew Ferguson joined my staff to lead the \\nteam of special counsels to specifically assist with the Supreme Court \\nnomination. Andrew led by example with his tireless work ethic and, of \\ncourse, his legal talent.\\n  I also want to thank special counsels Tyler Badgley, Lucas Croslow, \\nColleen Ernst, Megan McGlynn, and Collin White. This team read every \\nword of Justice Kavanaugh's more than 500,000 pages from his time as an \\nexecutive branch lawyer, the 307 opinions he authored on the DC Circuit \\nCourt, and all other documents relevant to his nomination.\\n  Rachel Mitchell was part of this special counsel team, offering her \\nexpertise and many years of experience at a time when we needed extra \\nhelp when we had Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh before our committee for \\na second set of hearings.\\n  Law clerks Tim Rodriguez, Camille Peeples, Abby Hollenstein, Dario \\nCamacho, Elizabeth Donald, Michael Talent, Bob Minchin, Nathan \\nWilliams, Sam Adkisson, and Asher Perez had the opportunity to \\ncontribute and learn during this nomination. I thank them for their \\nhard work and service here in the Senate, on top of their rigorous \\neducation. I thank the intern Jacob Ramer for his contribution as well.\\n  Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation process resulted in a record number \\nof pages available to Senators, including questions for the record. \\nThis team handled it all.\\n  Over the course of my Senate service, I have established a reputation \\nfor my oversight work. I am equipped with a permanent staff of \\nexperienced investigators. When allegations of sexual assault were \\nbrought to my attention on September 13, I was fortunate to have this \\nexperienced and highly regarded division of my staff already on the job\\n\\n[[Page S6713]]\\n\\nto help run down every question and allegation we received.\\n  I thank DeLisa Lay, Patrick Davis, Josh Flynn-Brown, Katherine Nikas, \\nDaniel Parker, and executive branch detailee Andy Hromyak for their \\ndedication to investigation, oversight, and accountability.\\n  I also want to thank my talented communications team: Judiciary \\nCommittee communications director Taylor Foy and Judiciary Committee \\npress secretary George Hartmann, as well as Michael Zona, Nicole \\nTieman, and Alexa Den Herder for their hard work. October 6 will be a \\nmemorable date for Taylor, marking both his wedding anniversary and the \\nday Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed.\\n  I am thankful for my personal office staff, led by my chief of staff, \\nJill Kozeny. She has been on my staff for 31 years. I have long \\nappreciated Jill's advice and all of her hard work on my behalf.\\n  I am also grateful for Jennifer Heins, who makes a tremendous \\ncontribution every day, and every staffer who was part of this \\nconfirmation process, including Penne Barton, Zach Schultz, Katelyn \\nSchultz, Josie Wagler, and my State staff, who had to answer a lot of \\ntelephone calls over a period of 3 months, just dealing with people for \\nand against the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.\\n  I very much appreciate the rest of my Judiciary Committee staff, \\nincluding my deputy staff director, Rita Lari, who took care of things \\nwhile I was on the floor and during the long hours in the hearing.\\n  Finally, I appreciate the work of Leader McConnell's staff, most \\nimportantly, John Abegg.\\n\\n\\n                 Religious Freedom in China and Taiwan\\n\\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, October 10, is the 107th national day of the \\nRepublic of China on Taiwan.\\n  I would like to extend my congratulations to the people of Taiwan on \\nthis very important occasion and to express my appreciation for the \\nU.S.-Taiwan relations. We were allies in World War II and have been \\nclose strategic and economic partners for a very long time. However, as \\nthe Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan has evolved into a \\nthriving free-market democracy that is today, our relationship has even \\ndeepened and strengthened in a way that can only happen when two \\ncountries share core values.\\n  There are times when the economic or geopolitical interests of the \\nUnited States are aligned with those of another country that does not \\nfully embrace freedom as we do--whether that freedom is in the \\nmarketplace of goods and services or the marketplace of ideas in a \\ndemocratic context. We can and should seek to engage with countries \\nthat do not share our values where it is in our national interest, and \\nwe do that.\\n  Still, those relationships remain contingent on weighing economic and \\nsecurity costs and benefits. On the other hand, with free-market \\ndemocracies like Taiwan, there is at the heart of our relationship a \\nvery high degree of mutual understanding underpinning all of our \\ninteractions. Our shared values mean that our long-term economic and \\nstrategic interests are likely to remain aligned. For instance, market \\neconomies are more likely to seek mutually beneficial free and fair \\ntrade. Democracies tend not to seek hegemony but cooperation. In short, \\nour shared values provide the basis for an enduring and stable bond \\nthat can only exist between free people.\\n  One of those fundamental values that is dear to my heart is religious \\nfreedom. I know my colleagues are aware of the disturbing reports out \\nof the People's Republic of China about the closing and destruction of \\nchurches and the burning of Bibles. That is something we in the United \\nStates just do not understand how anybody, any country, could take this \\nsituation and think: Who is afraid of worshiping God? Well, it seems \\nthey have some problem in China.\\n\\n  In Xinjiang Province, the Chinese Government has rounded up over 1 \\nmillion Uighurs and Kazakh Muslims. Tibetan Buddhists and practitioners \\nof Falun Gong have also long had their freedom to practice their \\nbeliefs suppressed. This should disturb all free people.\\n  Of course, the Communist leaders of China have excuses for their \\nbehavior. One of these is the need for sinicization of nonnative \\nreligions. In other words, they think religions like Christianity as \\nfreely practiced are somehow not compatible with Chinese society. Of \\ncourse, from our point of view, that is strictly nuts.\\n  Just look at Taiwan. It has the same Chinese history, the same \\nChinese language, the same Chinese culture as mainland China. Yet, on \\nTaiwan, Christians and other religious groups practice their faith \\nfreely. No one gives even a second thought to whether this is \\ncompatible with their history and tradition because it is a matter of \\nconscience, not a matter of undercutting the government. That is why I \\ndon't understand why it is a problem for Beijing.\\n  In fact, Taiwan has arguably preserved traditional Chinese cultures \\nbetter than on the mainland. Chiang Kai-shek was able to rescue and \\nbring to Taiwan some of the most valuable treasures from Chinese \\nhistory. Of course, these items in Taiwanese society, in general, were \\nspared the horrors of the cultural revolution. Of course, the cultural \\nrevolution was when the Communist Party of China destroyed an untold \\nnumber of historical artifacts as well as cultural and religious sites. \\nAncient Chinese texts were burned, and there were massive human rights \\nabuses.\\n  Some have suggested that recent developments in China are the \\nbeginning of a new sort of cultural revolution. I hope not because we \\nknow what the results of that were 50 or 60 years ago.\\n  Whatever the Communist Chinese Government is thinking, its actions \\nhave shattered many illusions. The hope held by many in the United \\nStates was that robust engagement with the People's Republic of China \\non an economic and political level would help it to evolve into a free \\nmarket democracy. That hope has now dimmed significantly. Things seem \\nto be going quite in the opposite direction.\\n  This is a bad sign, then, for U.S.-China relations. If the Chinese \\nleaders would like to correct their current course and improve \\nrelations with the United States, just take the example of Taiwan. Just \\nlook across the Taiwan Strait for that model: Chinese people, just like \\nthey are in Beijing.\\n  As the people of Taiwan celebrate their national day, I would like to \\nthank them for their friendship with our great country. The Republic of \\nChina on Taiwan continues to be a strong partner in trade, security, \\nand human rights. In fact, I should note that a delegation from Taiwan \\nrecently visited my home State of Iowa to increase their purchases of \\nsoybeans, and I greatly appreciate that, along with 88,000 Iowa \\nfarmers.\\n  Finally, I would like to thank Taiwan for being a model of a free and \\ndemocratic society when it can have a mutually beneficial partnership \\nwith the United States.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\\n\\n\\n                         Health Insurance Plans\\n\\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of 152,000 of my \\nconstituents in Montana with preexisting conditions. These are folks \\nwho are struggling with things like diabetes and heart disease and \\nasthma and cancer. Many of them are just one medical bill away from \\nbankruptcy. Thankfully, their health insurance is there for them when \\nthey need it, whether it be for a joint replacement or to undergo chemo \\nor to have a baby.\\n  Federal law holds health insurance companies accountable that their \\nplans cover us when we need it. Unfortunately, those rules are being \\ntossed out so big insurance can make a quick buck at the expense of \\nworking families.\\n  Just last week, health insurance companies started flooding the \\nmarket with junk plans. These plans are marketed as cheap insurance \\nthat will keep you healthy. Fifty bucks a month for full coverage, they \\nsay; $8.95 a week for top-rated coverage, they claim. Now, that is a \\nheck of a deal.\\n  Well, not so fast. They are total and complete shams. If you read the \\nfine print, you will discover that dialysis, blood pressure pills, and \\nx rays aren't covered. In fact, most things are not covered.\\n  Originally, insurance companies designed these plans to provide \\nstopgap coverage when you changed jobs or needed health insurance for \\njust a few months. They figured you could get by\\n\\n[[Page S6714]]\\n\\nwith a bare-bones policy for a month or two. They were never designed \\nto provide coverage for an entire year, let alone three, but now that \\nhas all changed.\\n  Starting last week, health insurance companies now have permission to \\nsell long-term junk plans to Montana's families. What was once a short-\\nterm solution is now becoming a long-term problem.\\n  So let's ask ourselves why we buy insurance in the first place. It is \\nfor risk management. Why do we buy auto insurance? It is in case you \\nget in an auto wreck. You hope you never have to use it, but if you do, \\nyou need that insurance to take care of that automobile to get it back \\non the road again.\\n  Why do we buy fire insurance? In case you have a fire. You hope it \\nnever ever happens, but every once in a while it does, and if you are \\nunfortunate and it happens to you, you have fire insurance to rebuild \\nyour home.\\n  I am a farmer. Why do you have crop insurance? You have crop \\ninsurance in that case where Mother Nature may not be smiling upon you; \\nyou may not get the rain at the appropriate time or you may get a \\nhailstorm that wipes you out. You hope it never happens, but if it \\ndoes, you have that crop insurance you can depend upon to manage your \\nrisk.\\n  So why do you buy health insurance? Is it because you plan on getting \\nsick? I don't think so. It is because, if you get sick, you will need \\nthe coverage. If you end up with high blood pressure, you have the \\ncoverage to help offset those costs.\\n  Unfortunately, with these junk plans, they are called junk for a \\nreason--because they don't cover anything. They give you a false sense \\nof hope and a false sense of coverage and you have no coverage.\\n  I want to take you back to 1965. In 1965, my parents bought an \\naccident insurance policy. It was supposed to cover accidents. Guess \\nwhat happened in 1965. I got in a little accident with a meat grinder, \\nand that insurance policy covered nothing. My folks had to dig deep and \\npay for the cost. When they thought they had insurance, they had \\nnothing.\\n  I was young, but I can still remember how angry my father was that \\nthey had been sold a bill of goods. That is exactly what it is with \\nthese junk insurance plans.\\n  Montanans are getting grifted. They are being sold a bill of goods. \\nThey are being lied to, deceived, and I will do whatever I can do to \\nkeep the junk out of our healthcare.\\n  We must hold big insurance companies accountable. We cannot let \\ncorporations swindle folks who need health insurance when, in the end, \\nthey have nothing.\\n  The bill before us this week does that. It keeps short-term plans \\nshort term. It stops insurance companies from selling garbage plans \\nthat don't cover preexisting conditions.\\n  That is why I am urging my colleagues to vote for this resolution, to \\nstand up for Montanans across the State and Americans across this \\ncountry. These are folks who work hard to put food on the table, and \\nthey shouldn't have to choose between a doctor's appointment and a \\nutility bill.\\n  Today I rise for those folks from Miles City, Harlowton, and Libby \\nand promise to defend them from these shoddy plans.\\n  With that, I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                                S. 3021\\n\\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in a few minutes, hopefully, the Senate \\nwill vote to invoke cloture on the motion to concur on the America's \\nWater Infrastructure Act of 2018. In preparing to take this vote, I \\nwant to remind our colleagues why this bill is so important not just \\nfor our country's economy but for our environment as well.\\n  The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, will mention shortly that \\nthis is a comprehensive bill that supports the Army Corps of Engineers. \\nIt supports EPA's drinking water and wastewater programs. It authorizes \\nthe Corps to construct, modify, study, and expedite more than 100 water \\nresource development projects. It prepares our country's water \\ninfrastructure for extreme weather events to avoid devastation caused \\nby storms like Hurricane Florence by reauthorizing levee and dam safety \\nprograms through 2023.\\n  It also establishes programs to make communities more resistant to \\nsea level rise. It reauthorizes, for the first time in 22 years, the \\nDrinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, which provides for needed \\ninvestments in water and sanitation infrastructure all across our \\ncountry.\\n  This bill would also nearly double the size of this critical loan \\nprogram from $1 billion to almost $2 billion by 2021. It expands the \\nexisting $60 million annual small and disadvantaged communities program \\nto allow for the testing and treatment of contamination in drinking \\nwater systems. It provides schools with the resources needed to address \\nlead contamination.\\n  This bipartisan bill is a major win for families across the country. \\nIt passed both the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \\nthe House unanimously, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote \\nyes on this cloture motion.\\n  Before I yield, I just want to say to my friend Senator Barrasso how \\nproud I have been to work with him. Our staffs are really a model of \\nthe way this place should work. We worked well not only with our \\ncolleagues on our committee and outside of our committee but also with \\nthe folks over in the House of Representatives. I will talk about them \\nlater today. To my chairman, it is a real pleasure to work with you on \\nthis one.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my \\nbrief remarks before the rollcall vote.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first I wish to thank my colleague and \\nfriend from Delaware, Senator Carper, for his friendship, leadership, \\nand advocacy on this important piece of legislation. We worked closely \\ntogether.\\n  I rise in support of S. 2031, America's Water Infrastructure Act of \\n2018.\\n  Every day, Americans depend on our Nation's water infrastructure \\nsystems. Clean water, flood control structures, working irrigation \\nsystems are all necessary for health, safety, and prosperity for our \\ncommunities.\\n  This legislation is going to authorize important water projects. It \\nwill maintain the navigability of inland waterways and coastal ports, \\nincrease water storage, and fix aging irrigation systems across the \\ncountry.\\n  It will create jobs. It will spur economic growth and give local \\nleaders an increased say in the projects and the way the projects are \\nprioritized. It will rebuild flood control systems.\\n  This is the most significant drinking water legislation in decades. \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act will cut Washington redtape; it will \\nhelp grow the economy; and it will keep communities safe.\\n  The legislation is good for all 50 States. It is bipartisan. It is \\nbicameral. The legislation passed the Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee by a vote of 21 to 0. It passed the House by unanimous \\nconsent on a voice vote.\\n  It has the support of a broad array of stakeholders, from the \\nAmerican Farm Bureau to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to the National \\nAssociation of Manufacturers, to the Family Farm Alliance. As a \\ntestament to just how broad the support is for this bill, both the \\nAmerican Petroleum Institute and the Sierra Club have endorsed its \\npassage. We don't see that every day.\\n  It is time to pass this important legislation and send it to \\nPresident Trump for his signature.

On this vote, the yeas are 96, the \\nnays are 3.\\n  Three-fifths of the Senators having voted in the affirmative, the \\nmotion is agreed to. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer \\namendments pending thereto fall.\\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, water infrastructure, a bill that we \\nhave just moved to a positive cloture vote, 96 to 3--water \\ninfrastructure is important to every State, as we see by this vote--\\nevery territory, every community, and every Tribe in this country. \\nThese systems support America's economic growth and our \\ncompetitiveness. They deliver drinking water and treat wastewater. They \\nprovide water for crops, cattle, and small businesses. They are used to \\nship American-made goods from the heartland to the coasts and around \\nthe world. They keep homes safe from dangerous flood waters; they store \\nwater for times of drought.\\n  These systems are vital to our country. We must maintain, upgrade, \\nand, where necessary, build them.\\n  During the State of the Union Address this year, President Trump \\ncalled on Congress to act on infrastructure. He said we will build \\nAmerica's infrastructure ``with American heart, American hands, and \\nAmerican grit.''\\n  Water infrastructure is a major part of the President's call. That is \\nwhy I introduced America's Water Infrastructure Act, along with my \\nfellow leaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators \\nCarper, Inhofe, and Cardin. Several other committee members were also \\ncosponsors, including Senators Capito, Wicker, Van Hollen, Boozman, \\nWhitehouse, and Sullivan.\\n  Politico called America's Water Infrastructure Act the most \\nsignificant infrastructure legislation to be taken up under the Trump \\nadministration so far. This legislation passed the Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee in the Senate unanimously, 21 to 0.\\n  Last month, the same leaders from our committee and the leadership of \\nthe committees in the House of Representatives reached a deal on \\nhistoric comprehensive water infrastructure legislation. America's \\nWater Infrastructure Act now has broad bicameral and bipartisan \\nsupport.\\n  Our bill will help grow the economy, will cut Washington redtape, and \\nwill keep communities safe.\\n  Authorizing important water projects will create jobs that will spur \\neconomic growth. The legislation will help deepen nationally \\nsignificant ports and maintain the navigability of inland waterways. It \\nis going to increase storage in the West and build new flood management \\ninfrastructure.\\n  This bill will fix aging dams and irrigation systems across the \\ncountry. Upgrading these systems will ensure that ranchers and farmers \\nwill get the water that they rely on.\\n  It will also help communities recover from devastating storms like \\nHurricane Florence and the damage it left along the east coast, \\nespecially in North and South Carolina.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act also cuts Washington redtape. As \\nchairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \\nheard time and again how State and local leaders know better than \\nWashington which projects would have the most positive impact on their \\ncommunity. Our bill will give local experts an increased role in \\nprioritizing which Army Corps projects get built.\\n  When a local partner takes over an Army Corps of Engineer's flood \\ncontrol project, they will no longer need to worry about obtaining \\nbrandnew permits. The Army Corps will simply transfer its authority to \\nthe local partner so that new permits are no longer necessary.\\n  The government will also provide technical assistance to smaller \\ncommunities to make it simpler for them to comply with environmental \\nlaws.\\n  Leveraging Federal dollars is an important element of President \\nTrump's infrastructure plan. We included language to help smaller rural \\ncommunities leverage their resources so that they can build water \\ninfrastructure projects. Federal leveraging programs, particularly the \\nWater Infrastructure Flexibility Act, allow taxpayers to get the most \\nbang for their buck.\\n  In the past, smaller rural communities have had trouble accessing \\nthese dollars. The language in our consensus bill will give these rural \\ncommunities the chance to compete for these funds and the ability to \\nparticipate in these successful programs.\\n  Cutting redtape and increasing access to these leveraging programs \\nwill help us get projects done faster, better, cheaper, and smarter. \\nThat is just common sense.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act is also about safety. In recent \\nyears, we have seen the damage that floods and droughts can cause. We \\nmust maintain and improve our dams, our beach fronts, our levies, and \\nour reservoirs.\\n  Our bill takes steps to address the backlog of maintenance needs of \\nthese infrastructure systems. It also creates a permanent program to \\nfind solutions for floods caused by ice jams.\\n  In the spring, and certainly in Wyoming, thawing ice and snow create \\njams in rivers and can cause them to overflow their banks. In my home \\nState of Wyoming, ice jam floods have been devastating for the towns of \\nGreybull and Worland. America's Water Infrastructure Act authorizes \\nimportant programs to find permanent ways to prevent these types of \\nfloods.\\n  This bill is about more than just flood prevention. It is the most \\nsignificant drinking water legislation in decades. The bill authorizes \\nfunds to repair aging drinking water systems.\\n  For the first time since 1996--that is 22 years ago--Congress will be \\nauthorizing the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. These funds give \\nStates certainty--certainty that they can meet their drinking water \\nneeds. That is a big deal.\\n  There is a line that people say in Wyoming. It was originally \\nattributed to Mark Twain. The line is this: Whiskey is for drinking; \\nwater is for fighting over. That is not the case with America's Water \\nInfrastructure Act.\\n\\n[[Page S6716]]\\n\\n  That is not the case with America's Water Infrastructure Act. \\nDemocrats and Republicans are working together in a bipartisan way. The \\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate are working together in a \\nbicameral way. The House of Representatives passed this consensus bill \\nunanimously by voice vote. Now it is the Senate's turn. We all know how \\nimportant this legislation is for our country, for our States, and for \\nour constituents. The bill is bipartisan and is fiscally responsible. \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act actually reduces the deficit.\\n  I thank Ranking Member Carper and Subcommittee Chairman Inhofe and \\nSubcommittee Ranking Member Cardin and their staffs for their \\nleadership in working through this process. They have been wonderful \\npartners in writing legislation that will have a real impact all across \\nAmerica. This bill is for all of America. It will have a real impact in \\nour rural areas and in our big cities. It will help communities in the \\nheartland and communities on the coasts.\\n  It is now time to pass this legislation. Let's pass the American \\nWater Infrastructure Act and send it to President Trump for his \\nsignature.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Delaware.\\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today, along with the chairman, \\nSenator Barrasso, to further discuss the important piece of \\ninfrastructure legislation that he has outlined that will positively \\naffect the States of every Member of this body. I want to encourage \\neach of our colleagues to support it.\\n  Over the course of August and early September, the Senate Environment \\nand Public Works Committee reached an agreement with our counterparts \\nin the House to advance America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018.\\n  Our chairman, John Barrasso, and I coauthored this bill and did so \\nwith the help of the majority and minority staffs of the Environment \\nand Public Works Committee over the better part of this past year. I \\nwant to take a moment to thank our chairman, as I have earlier, for his \\nleadership. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \\nInfrastructure Subcommittee of EPW, Jim Inhofe and Ben Cardin, for \\ntheir leadership in producing this critical bipartisan legislation.\\n  I want to thank the members of their staffs and especially the \\nmajority and minority member EPW staffs, without whose help this bill \\nwould not be before us today. Collectively, you have done a terrific \\njob. I am proud of you. As we say in the Navy, Bravo Zulu, which means \\n``well done.''\\n  As some of you may recall, the Senate's version of the bill was \\nreported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously \\na few months back. On September 13, the bill passed the House of \\nRepresentatives unanimously on a voice vote.\\n  People back home say to me: Why can't you just work together? Well, \\nin this case, we have, and I think the results speak for themselves. I \\nam hopeful and encouraged that this bill will receive the same strong \\nsupport in the Senate this week.\\n  In a Congress and a country that are all too often divided, it is \\nrefreshing to me and I think to others as well that we have been able \\nto come together to authorize water infrastructure and drinking water \\nprograms that are both vital and critical to the American people's way \\nof life.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 is a win-win for our \\nNation's economy and for our environment. This bill should serve as a \\nmodel for how we can get meaningful legislation done in Congress, and I \\nhope it will serve as a model.\\n  This legislation supports the ongoing work of the U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers. It does so by reauthorizing the Corps' program for flood \\ncontrol, for beach and shoreline maintenance, and for the maintenance \\nof inland and coastal waterways through which the goods that enter and \\ndepart from American ports travel.\\n  The Corps' Civil Works Program is our Nation's largest and I believe \\nthe world's biggest water resources undertaking. This program addresses \\na wide variety of priorities, including ship navigability; flood risk \\nmanagement; beach and shoreline protection; renewable energy, such as \\nhydropower; water supply; and environmental restoration and \\nstewardship. In fact, over 99 percent of U.S. overseas trade moves \\nthrough the waterways which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is \\nresponsible for maintaining. Think of that--99 percent.\\n  In fact, this bill supports the Corps' operation and maintenance of \\n13,000 miles of commercial deep-draft ship channels and 12,000 miles of \\ncommercial inland waterways. These ports and waterways serve a combined \\n40 States and transport much of our country's waterborne cargo.\\n  The new authorizations that this bill provides are critically needed. \\nMuch of the infrastructure that the Corps is responsible for across the \\ncountry now exceeds its useful lifespan. As a result, we have an \\nenormous construction backlog of needed infrastructure investments. The \\nlatest estimates from the Army Corps indicate that the overall \\nconstruction backlog is in the neighborhood of $96 billion, while the \\nannual budget of the Army Corps hovers around $4.6 billion. Think of \\nthat--$96 billion on the one hand and $4.6 billion on the other hand. \\nThose two numbers reflect the extraordinary challenge the Army Corps \\nfaces--a challenge we begin to address with this legislation. This bill \\naddresses that backlog by providing new tools that will allow the \\ngovernment to partner with the Corps and leverage existing resources to \\nmake sure we get the most bang for our buck.\\n  This legislation also increases local participation, transparency, \\nand accountability in developing the Army Corps' annual budget. It is \\nmy hope that enhanced local participation will allow for a more \\ntransparent and long-term look at the Corps' activities and help build \\na greater groundswell of support for increased appropriations to fund \\nthe agency's initiatives.\\n  The measure before us also authorizes critical Corps of Engineers \\ndisaster programs. When disaster strikes, the Federal Government often \\nsteps in and helps, as it did last year in Puerto Rico, \\nFlorida, Louisiana, Texas, and this year in the Carolinas. A large part \\nof that help is provided by the Army Corps of Engineers--something that \\nmay come as a surprise to Americans who don't realize the critical role \\nthe Corps plays in responding to all sorts of emergencies.\\n\\n  In addition, this bill includes new authorities to help protect \\ncommunities and ecosystems in coastal States like Delaware and Maryland \\nand States across our country from some of the worst impacts of extreme \\nweather events. This measure includes provisions that allow communities \\nto recover more quickly, too, when disaster does strike and facilitates \\nrebuilding facilities in ways that are more resilient to future storms.\\n  This legislation also makes key changes in emergency response, post-\\ndisaster recovery, and resiliency efforts so that the Army Corps thinks \\nlong-term instead of short-term when it selects solutions that it will \\nimplement. But the bill goes even further. It enables the Corps to \\npursue the best possible solutions to make communities more resistant \\nto storm damage, whether those solutions are a traditionally \\nconstructed levee or a natural alternative, like the reconstructed \\ndunes we are using along the Delaware coast and other places too.\\n  Earlier this year, NOAA announced that the total cost for extreme \\nweather and climate events in 2017 exceeded $300 billion. That is a new \\nU.S. annual record--$300 billion in 1 year, last year. It is not a \\nmatter of if the next extreme weather event is coming, it is a matter \\nof when. As storm events, such as Hurricane Florence, grow more \\npowerful and prevalent, threatening American lives and infrastructure, \\nthe passage of this bill--a bill that will help protect coastal \\ncommunities from the risk of flooding--has never been more important.\\n  In addition to strengthening key Corps programs, this bill also \\naddresses key programs at EPA for major drinking water and wastewater \\nneeds across our country. For the first time in over 20 years, this \\nbill reauthorizes the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, too. \\nThat program provides Federal assistance to help communities with clean \\ndrinking water. It does so through no-interest, low-interest, and\\n\\n[[Page S6717]]\\n\\nforgivable loans that help communities in a variety of ways gain access \\nto capital that would otherwise be unavailable. It is my hope that one \\nday we can eventually add grants back into this program for communities \\nthat need the help the most, but that is probably a longer conversation \\nsomewhere down the line.\\n  The ongoing crisis in Flint that we are now seeing play out in far \\ntoo many communities across our country is tragic but avoidable if we \\ninvest in water infrastructure more wisely. This bill makes it clear \\nthat we have learned our lesson, and we are beginning to take some \\nsteps to address this enormous challenge.\\n  Some of our colleagues may recall that earlier this year Senator \\nDuckworth and I hosted a drinking water roundtable here on Capitol \\nHill. The image of her holding up in her hand a baby bottle with \\nformula made from contaminated drinking water is an image that is hard \\nfor me to forget.\\n  This bill authorizes more resources for EPA to make sure that every \\nparent, no matter what their ZIP Code is, where they live, can be \\nconfident that the water coming out of the tap at home or at their \\nchildren's school is safe for their kids to drink. Toward that end, \\nthis legislation not only reauthorizes the safe drinking water \\nrevolving loan program, it nearly doubles its funding. By fiscal year \\n2021, the program will grow from the current authorization of $1 \\nbillion to almost $2 billion.\\n  Perhaps most notably, especially in light of the avoidable \\ndevastation and tragedy we saw in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and \\nHarvey, this bill authorizes $100 million to repair drinking water \\nsystems damaged by storms and creates a new program that helps protect \\ndrinking water systems from extreme weather events.\\n  This legislation allows States that detect contaminants in drinking \\nwater to provide assistance to residents who depend on private water \\nwells. This provision should matter to every Member of Congress whose \\nresidents rely significantly on wells for their water consumption \\nneeds, and we have them in every single State across America. I don't \\nknow about other States, but one in six Delawareans depends on private \\nwells for their drinking water. It is not fair that if contaminants end \\nup in their water through no fault of the resident, the resident has to \\nfind a way to rectify that situation on their own. Without this bill, \\nthese taxpayers get no support, and that is not right.\\n  This bill goes way beyond addressing emergency situations. It \\nprovides a framework for updating and expanding water infrastructure \\nsystems throughout our country at both the EPA and the Army Corps of \\nEngineers.\\n  As I mentioned earlier, the bill authorizes $50 million for technical \\nassistance to help schools and daycare centers deal with lead \\ncontamination in their drinking water and another $5 million per year \\nin grants for modernizing, testing, and replacing the lead components \\nthat are causing the water contamination. This provision is going to be \\nparticularly helpful in places like Chicago and Baltimore, where there \\nare schools operating with no usable drinking water fountains.\\n  Oftentimes, our water infrastructure is the forgotten leg of the \\ninfrastructure stool. We rightly worry about the infrastructure we can \\nsee, such as bridges, highways, airports, and railroads, but our water \\ninfrastructure--our pipes, shipping channels, flood control structures; \\nthe infrastructure we don't see but rely on every day--is also in \\ndesperate need of investment in many parts of America.\\n  Before I yield the floor today, I want to again thank our chairman, \\nSenator Barrasso, and our Senators from Maryland and Oklahoma who are \\nthe cochairs of the Infrastructure Subcommittee of Environment and \\nPublic Works and other members of our committee and frankly those who \\nare not fortunate enough to serve on our committee. I thank them for \\ntheir hard work throughout this process.\\n  I thank our colleagues over in the House--Congressmen Shuster, \\nDeFazio, Walden, and Pallone--who were great partners of ours. When we \\nwork together as Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers, we are \\nstronger, and when we are stronger here, we are stronger across our \\ncountry.\\n  Finally, I thank the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers, R.D. James, who has made this legislation a priority for the \\nArmy Corps and for the administration. He and his team worked with us \\nto craft a bill that I think we can all be proud of, and I am.\\n  I want to mention again that as smart as John Barrasso and I and the \\nother Senators who serve on our committee and here in the Senate are, \\nthis bill wouldn't be before us if we didn't have some very smart \\npeople on our staffs. One is sitting right here next to me today, and \\nsome others are standing behind me. I see over on the Republican \\nmajority side some terrific members of staff who work under the \\nleadership of our chairman. I want to take a moment to take my hat \\noff--I wish I were wearing my hat. If I were, I would take it off to \\nall of you, as well.\\n\\n  Let me end today with an African proverb that I think is particularly \\nrelevant. It goes something like this: If you want to go fast, travel \\nalone. If you want to go far, travel together.\\n  By working together, we crafted legislation that is both substantive \\nand needed. This proposal stands as a timely example of how we can set \\naside our differences and get meaningful work done for the people who \\nsent us here and expected us to accomplish really important things like \\nthis on their behalf.\\n  The underlying bill before us is one that delivers a lot of good to \\nthe American people. At the same time, it represents good public policy \\nthat is fiscally responsible. It is deserving of the support of our \\ncolleagues in the Senate. I hope they will join us in supporting its \\npassage.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank my \\nranking member and partner in this bipartisan bill, Senator Carper. You \\ncould not have asked for a better colead moving this legislation \\nforward. I agree with exactly the sentiments expressed by the senior \\nSenator from Delaware that America's Water Infrastructure Act could not \\nhave happened without a lot of hard work from a number of dedicated \\nlegislators, as well as dedicated staff.\\n  I also thank the chairman and ranking member of our Transportation \\nand Infrastructure Subcommittee, Chairman Inhofe, Ranking Member \\nCardin, and their staffs for their important contributions and their \\nstrong support.\\n  As Senator Carper mentioned the House, I thank our colleagues there \\nand partners in this effort, Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member \\nDeFazio of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; Chairman \\nWalden and Ranking Member Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee, \\nalong with their staff. They did a significant amount of heavy lifting \\nto get this important water infrastructure bill to the finish line.\\n  Finally, I thank the staff of the Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee for their tireless work on the legislation. Senator Carper \\nmentioned them from both sides of the aisle.\\n  On my staff, I thank Richard Russell, Brian Clifford, Andrew Harding, \\nLizzy Olsen, Pauline Thorndike, Craig Thomas, and Mike Danlak, and my \\nchief of staff, Dan Coonsman.\\n  On the minority staff, I thank Mary Frances Repko, John Kane, Andrew \\nRogers, Christina Baysinger, Skylar Bayer, Ashley Morgan, and Avery \\nMulligan. It would not have happened without all of their hard work, \\ndedication, and commitment to this piece of legislation.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n                               Healthcare\\n\\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while it is perhaps not in line with \\nofficial and genuine Senate protocol, I also want to use this \\nopportunity to congratulate my good friend in the Chair on the \\nwonderful events of last weekend for his family.\\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss my colleague \\nSenator\\n\\n[[Page S6718]]\\n\\nBaldwin's resolution that would protect the millions of Americans in \\nWisconsin and Oregon and all across the land who are faced with \\npreexisting health conditions.\\n  This has been an area I have focused on since my days as codirector \\nof the Oregon Gray Panthers because preexisting conditions is kind of \\nfancy lingo that people talk about as it relates to healthcare policy, \\nbut really what it is all about is, if you have cancer or diabetes or \\nheart disease or asthma or any one of a score of healthcare conditions, \\nbefore the Affordable Care Act, you were just in a world of hurt, \\nliterally and figuratively. In effect, the healthcare system then was \\nfor the healthy and the wealthy. If you were healthy, there was nothing \\nto worry about--no preexisting condition. If you were wealthy, you just \\npaid the bills, but if you had preexisting conditions, as millions and \\nmillions of Americans have, then you were really out of luck.\\n\\n  So then, along came the Affordable Care Act. I had written a piece of \\nlegislation, the Healthy Americans Act, with seven Democrats and seven \\nRepublicans as cosponsors. It had airtight, loophole-free protection \\nfor Americans against discrimination if they had preexisting \\nconditions. That provision from the Healthy Americans Act, to a very \\ngreat extent, made its way into the Affordable Care Act. That is why \\nmillions of Americans were able to go to bed at night with a sense of \\ncomfort and a sense that if they did have healthcare conditions, the \\ninsurance companies wouldn't be able to just clobber them with higher \\ncosts. Unfortunately, we have the Trump administration's wanting to \\nbring back the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy and \\nallow discrimination against people with preexisting conditions.\\n  The flip side of the preexisting condition coin is junk insurance--\\nselling junk insurance that really isn't worth a whole lot more than \\nthe paper it is written on. Boy, do I know something about junk \\ninsurance because that is how I started my time in public service, when \\nsenior citizens were sold 15 to 20 policies. Again, the rip-offs were \\nbuilt in. Back then, if you had one policy and you had another policy \\nthat offered similar coverage, they canceled each other out, and the \\nsenior got nothing. It was junk insurance. If we go back to the days \\nwhen they discriminated against people with preexisting conditions, we \\nare going to have junk insurance all over again.\\n  I am going to begin with the Trump administration's record on this.\\n  First of all, if you are a scam artist who is peddling junk plans, \\nthe Trump administration has your back. If you are a person with a \\npreexisting condition, the Trump administration is advancing policies \\nthat will make both your health and your wallet in far worse shape. \\nNow, the Trump officials get up and talk about the benefits of short-\\nterm plans. They will use buzz words like ``flexibility'' and \\n``patient-centered care,'' but I want everybody to be clear that it is \\njunk insurance, plain and simple. It is putting a whole lot of lipstick \\non a frog.\\n  These junk insurance plans the Trump administration has revived \\nrepresent the very worst of industry tricks and abuses. They punish \\nAmericans who really need healthcare. If you are young, if you are \\nhealthy, and if you are wealthy, as I have said, there is nothing to \\nworry about. With junk plans, you have a glide path to put scams on \\nthose with preexisting conditions like heart disease, cancer, and \\nmental illness. They exist to prey on older Americans--on women, on the \\nless fortunate--particularly a group that I have thought was the heart \\nof where healthcare reform ought to go--to the folks between 55 and 65.\\n  As I have indicated, junk plans are not new. Congress and the \\nAmerican people have rejected them before. I mentioned my history with \\nthe Oregon Gray Panthers. Big, thick stacks of legalese that nobody \\ncould understand were always hyped to the seniors. They were going to \\nfill the gaps in Medicare. It was called Medigap. Back then, it was \\nreally just A and B. It didn't have D and Medicare Advantage and all \\nkinds of other things. It was just A and B.\\n  You had seniors frightened that the gaps in Medicare were going to \\nconsume any savings they might have. So every time a fast-talking \\nsalesperson came through, a senior would buy a policy. When I was the \\ndirector of the Gray Panthers, it was common to go to seniors' homes, \\nand they would actually go to a closet and pull out a shoebox full of \\nthese worthless policies. I really fear we are looking at going back to \\nthose days.\\n  The fact is that Congress finally cracked down on those Medigap rip-\\noffs. I had an opportunity to be a part of that effort as a Member of \\nthe other body, the House, but a lot of people got hurt in the process.\\n  Junk insurance was not just a problem for seniors. A few years ago, \\nthe Affordable Care Act was designed, as I mentioned, in terms of the \\nHealthy Americans Act, to make sure that junk insurance would be \\neliminated across the board. Across the board, we would say in our \\ncountry, we are going to have ironclad, loophole-free guarantees that \\nno American would ever face discrimination over a preexisting \\ncondition.\\n  By the way, that used to be a bipartisan proposition. The fact is \\nthat still serving in this body are a number of my colleagues on the \\nRepublican side who are cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act, with \\nthat ironclad, loophole-free protection for those with preexisting \\nconditions. So it is not as if somebody just kind of brought this up as \\na partisan issue. It was bipartisan then. Republican Members of this \\nbody, distinguished colleagues, were cosponsors of that Healthy \\nAmericans Act proposition. Now the Trump administration is trying to \\nturn back the clock. It wants to make junk plans great again--a forced \\nmarch back to those days that I described that were only for the \\nhealthy and the wealthy.\\n\\n  The open enrollment plan for health insurance is coming up very \\nquickly. The Trump administration has cut it in half so that it is \\ngoing to last only a few weeks this year. That means, during the \\nholidays, when Americans are traveling, shopping, and spending time \\nwith family, they will also have to make some judgments about health \\ninsurance. Because of the Trump administration's actions, these junk \\ninsurance policies are going to be peddled at the same time as \\ninsurance that would actually cover, meaningfully, the healthcare that \\nour people need.\\n  What they are going to be doing with these Trump changes is making \\nlife easy for the scam artists but a nightmare for so many Americans \\nwho, day in and day out, walk an economic tightrope just trying to pay \\nfor essentials. These rip-off artists under the Trump plan are going to \\nhave a green light to steal the money Americans pay in premiums and for \\nother expenses. According to a recent study, sometimes as much as $2 \\nout of every $3 is wasted on overhead with these administrative costs \\nand junk insurance profits in these flawed policies that the Trump \\nadministration wants to foist off on Americans.\\n  The disastrous effects of junk insurance aren't limited to those who \\nget conned into buying it. By bringing junk plans back, the Trump \\nadministration, in effect, goes out and swings a wrecking ball into the \\nprivate health insurance markets in our country. It raises costs across \\nthe board, and Americans waste their hard-earned dollars.\\n  Senator Baldwin has a resolution, and I commend my colleague from \\nWisconsin on her effort on this. She came and talked with me about this \\nearly on, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. We \\nhave jurisdiction over something like $1 trillion worth of health \\nspending. I really appreciate the expertise and the passion that \\nSenator Baldwin has brought to this issue, and we saw it in her very \\nfirst presentation on what she wanted to do. Her resolution is the \\nSenate's best opportunity to put a stop to the scams that I have \\ndescribed. It would throw the Trump administration's junk insurance \\nrules out, and with Senator Baldwin's proposal, it would restore the \\nprotections that millions of Americans count on each day.\\n  The Democrats in the Senate are going to stand up for Americans with \\npreexisting conditions, and I hope colleagues on the other side will \\njoin us. I recognize that the Trump administration will not, but my \\nhope is that we will have colleagues on the other side supporting us \\nfor Senator Baldwin's resolution.\\n\\n[[Page S6719]]\\n\\n  In addition, as if this were not enough of an injury foisted on \\nvulnerable Americans, the Trump administration has put forward a \\nnominee for a seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals who made \\nhealthcare sabotage one of his top priorities at the Trump Justice \\nDepartment. Chad Readler, currently the Deputy Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral, in my view, is the wrong choice to be a Federal judge.\\n  Earlier this year, the Trump administration decided it just wanted to \\nget out of the business of enforcing the rules that protect Americans \\nwith preexisting conditions. In fact, it had to argue in court that it \\ncould abandon that essential part of the Affordable Care Act, which was \\nstill the law of the land the last time I looked. Who did the \\nadministration turn to when it needed to cook up a dubious legal \\nargument that it had no obligation to enforce the law of the land? Chad \\nReadler. In fact, three career attorneys from the Department of Justice \\nlooked at his argument, and they actually withdrew from the case. Three \\ncareer lawyers from the Department of Justice refused to participate.\\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Mr. Readler's nomination \\nearlier this month. His nomination could be sent to the floor of the \\nSenate in the coming weeks, but it ought to be clear that this is a \\nnominee who is not an impartial individual who has the judicial \\ntemperament Americans expect. He is not somebody who ought to be handed \\na seat on the Federal bench and have the power to sign off on the Trump \\nadministration's agenda of healthcare sabotage.\\n  I close with this. The Senate has an opportunity to stand up this \\nweek for the millions of vulnerable Americans who have these \\npreexisting conditions, for the millions of Americans who under the \\nAffordable Care Act can go to bed at night knowing that if they have \\npreexisting conditions, they are not going to lose everything. I am \\nserious when I talk about losing everything. Once you go back to \\ndiscriminating against people with preexisting conditions, you are \\ngoing to go back to job lock and all of the problems we saw associated \\nwith discrimination. If you were in Montana or if you were in Oregon \\nand had a preexisting condition and you got offered a better job on the \\nother side of town, you couldn't go get it because you would not be \\nable to get coverage because there was discrimination against people \\nwith preexisting conditions.\\n  This week the Senate is going to have an opportunity to stand up to \\nthe Trump administration and go to bat for the millions and millions of \\nAmericans who are watching this debate who have preexisting conditions \\nand who are just counting on this body not to turn back the clock and \\nleave them vulnerable again. Senator Baldwin's resolution would prevent \\nthe Trump administration from bringing back the worst abuses of junk \\ninsurance. If it doesn't pass this week, this will be an issue that, in \\nmy view, will come up again and again and again until it is fixed.\\n  Finally, the Readler nomination, in my view, ought to be stopped in \\nits tracks. The Senate ought to tell the administration that it is not \\ngoing to rubberstamp judicial nominees who have proven, demonstrable \\ntrack records of twisting the law in a way that harms the most \\nvulnerable of our citizens.\\n  I note that the majority leader is here.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n\\n                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\""

       " \"Mr. President, first, I want to convey a few words of \\nthanks to our dedicated Ambassador to the United Nations, who we just \\nlearned will be stepping down at the end of the year.\\n  Our Nation has benefited greatly from the tough, skilled leadership \\nthat Nikki Haley brought to the U.N. Her tenure will be remembered for \\nher proud reassertion of American moral leadership and her fearless \\nwillingness to turn a bright spotlight on critical challenges, from \\nIsraeli's sovereignty to Iran's sponsorship of regional violence.\\n  Ambassador Haley has been a key part of the administration's team \\nthat has faced down a wide variety of critical challenges, and she has \\ndone so with distinction.\\n  She took on this role after an impressive 6 years as Governor of \\nSouth Carolina and quickly proved to be both be a skillful advocate for \\nour national interest and a forceful spokeswoman for our principles.\\n  I hope this is not the end of Ambassador Haley's distinguished career \\nin public service. I thank her for her significant contributions to our \\ncountry.\\n\\n\\n                    Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\\n\\n  Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday, I was pleased to attend \\nthe ceremonial swearing-in for the newest member of our Supreme Court--\\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh.\\n  Justice Kavanaugh's remarks yesterday affirmed yet again what his \\nrecord and his testimony clearly told us: He will be a thoughtful, \\nfairminded Justice who is committed to applying our laws and our \\nConstitution as they are actually written.\\n  His confirmation last week was a victory for the very same principles \\nof fairness and justice we can now count on with him--along with his \\nfellow Justices--to uphold.\\n  Saturday's vote was also a victory for the Senate--for this \\ninstitution--and for the integrity of this institution. Reason and \\ndeliberation triumphed over what was literally--literally--an attempt \\nto sway the Senate using mob tactics. I wish this were an exaggeration, \\nbut it isn't.\\n  While many came to Washington peacefully to share their stories, the \\nloudest voices proved to be those of the politically motivated far \\nleft--the same far left special interests that had pledged total \\nopposition to any Supreme Court nominee before the ink\\n\\n[[Page S6704]]\\n\\nwas even dry on Justice Kennedy's retirement. They pulled out all the \\nstops. They did everything they could.\\n  When it became clear Justice Kavanaugh's nomination would not be \\nstopped on the merits--well, as we know, that was only the beginning. \\nThe far-left activists decided that the U.S. Senate and their Members \\nshould be harassed and intimidated wherever they might be--in a \\nrestaurant with family, getting out of their own car, or in their own \\nhomes; anything went.\\n  When they did not get their way, when these tactics failed to sway \\nus, they just turned up the anger even more. Protestors disregarded the \\nmen and women of the Capitol Police, trampled barricades, stormed the \\nsteps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court, climbed on statues, and \\ntried to literally shout down Senators right in the middle of a \\nrollcall vote in the Senate.\\n  When the dust settled, literally hundreds of arrests had been made. \\nExtraordinary security measures were required to protect the Senate, \\nthe Supreme Court, as well as the Kavanaugh family. Members of this \\nbody and Senate staff have received threats of violence and murder.\\n  After all that, I am afraid the far left had succeeded in only one \\nthing: They made it even more difficult for the vast majority of \\nAmericans to take them seriously. They made it difficult for most \\nAmericans to take these people seriously.\\n  The madness hasn't stopped. They are already signaling that even more \\ndrastic steps may be necessary now that Justice Kavanaugh is on the \\nCourt.\\n  Some leftwing publications are already trying to lay the groundwork \\nfor--you guessed it--literally packing the Court with more Justices. \\nThat is right. The far left has gone scrounging through the ash heap of \\nAmerican history, and they are bandying about that discredited fantasy \\nfrom back in the 1930s.\\n  In the meantime, while the groundwork is laid for that scheme, one \\nfar-left pressure group is already trying to circulate petitions that \\nJustice Kavanaugh should be impeached--Justice Kavanaugh should be \\nimpeached.\\n  The mob would like to make themselves perfectly clear. If Democrats \\nwere to retake Congress, ``progessives expect them to use their full \\npower to get Kavanaugh off the bench.''\\n  So it is pretty obvious. The all-consuming animosity toward this \\nnominee, independent of all the facts and all the evidence, is still \\nbeing stoked. The far-left mob is not letting up.\\n  Early today, former Secretary of State Clinton sent this signal as \\nclear as day--this is Secretary Clinton. She told CNN exactly how she \\nviews millions of Americans who hold different political views from her \\nown. Here is what she said:\\n\\n       You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to \\n     destroy what you stand for. . . . If we are fortunate enough \\n     to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility \\n     can start again.\\n\\n  No peace until they get their way? More of these unhinged tactics?\\n  Apparently, this is the left's rallying cry, but fortunately the \\nAmerican people know the fact-free politics of hate, fear, and \\nintimidation are not how we actually govern in our democratic Republic.\\n  The Senate and the Nation will not be intimidated.\\n\\n\\n                                S. 3021\\n\\n  Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, earlier this year, \\nthe President challenged us to seriously address our Nation's crumbling \\ninfrastructure. We have wasted no time in Congress on working to tackle \\nthis challenge in a bipartisan way.\\n  Here are just a few highlights: The funding bill for fiscal 2018 \\nincluded a $21 billion increase in infrastructure funding. We continue \\nto build on that significant commitment in our historic return to \\nregular appropriations for fiscal year 2019.\\n  Just last week, we passed the longest FAA reauthorization in more \\nthan three decades on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. This week, we \\nhave the chance to keep the momentum going and advance another major \\nvictory for the American infrastructure by passing America's Water \\nInfrastructure Act.\\n  Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper deserve a lot of credit \\nfor getting this important bipartisan legislation across the finish \\nline. Its importance for every State in our Nation really cannot be \\noverstated.\\n  America's ports and inland waterways give our producers access to \\nmarkets around the world. For example, more than 60 percent of our \\ngrain exports move through our inland waterways and so do other \\ncommodities such as fuel, coal, and agricultural inputs.\\n  No wonder the American Farm Bureau Federation wrote the Senate, \\nexplaining that this legislation ``will put America's inland waterways \\nand port infrastructure on a solid and sustainable foundation to \\ncontribute to U.S. economic growth, jobs and global competitiveness for \\ngenerations to come.''\\n  This legislation covers big projects, like deepening ports and \\nensuring the navigability of inland waterways, but it also focuses on \\nthe unique challenges our local communities face. It will help ensure \\naccess to functioning sewer systems and clean drinking water.\\n  On the last point, there is good reason why the chairman of the EPW \\nCommittee calls this legislation ``the most significant drinking water \\ninfrastructure bill in decades.'' When you look at its contents, it is \\nhard to reach any other conclusion.\\n  There is more support for our rural communities as they grapple with \\naging water, sewer, and flood control infrastructure. The legislation \\nincludes Senator Boozman's SRF-WIN Act, which puts low-interest \\nfinancing within reach for small and midsized rural communities, like \\nthose in my home State of Kentucky.\\n  For the first time in over 20 years, this legislation reauthorizes \\nFederal funding to States to help ensure the safety of our drinking \\nwater.\\n  The legislation also addresses environmental protection. To name just \\none example, it includes an important effort championed by Senator \\nRubio and Governor Scott to help address harmful algal blooms that have \\nplagued Florida's waterways. These are just a few of the significant \\naccomplishments this legislation secures. Dams and levees, flood \\ncontrol for our communities, safe drinking water, and sewer systems in \\ncommunities big and small.\\n\\n  The bill before us addresses real needs in my State and across \\nAmerica. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act later today.\\n\\n\\n                    Confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\\n\\n  Now, on one final matter, I would like to conclude where I started, \\nwith a few words of thanks for a job well done. Justice Kavanaugh's \\nconfirmation could not have happened without the tireless work of so \\nmany. So while I certainly can't mention everyone who is deserving, I \\nwish to take a moment to express my gratitude.\\n  First, of course, is President Trump himself, for sending to the \\nSenate such a talented and qualified nominee. He and Vice President \\nPence are stalwart champions for the judiciary that the American people \\ndeserve.\\n  My deep gratitude also goes to White House Counsel Don McGahn. \\nWithout Don's total dedication to ensuring that Judge Kavanaugh \\nreceived a fair hearing, we would not be where we are today.\\n  Here in the Senate, I can't compliment enough our dear friend \\nChairman Grassley for his leadership of the Judiciary Committee. He \\nbalanced strong leadership with generosity and flexibility to all of \\nthe Members. He oversaw the most thorough, painstaking review of a \\nSupreme Court nominee in our Nation's history.\\n  Supporting Chairman Grassley and the committee, I would like to \\nmention the following individuals: Staff Director Kolan Davis, Chief \\nNominations Counsel Mike Davis, Steve Kenny, Lauren Mehler, Andrew \\nFerguson, Taylor Foy, Rachel Mitchell, Katharine Willey, Jessica Vu, \\nGeorge Hartman, Jill Kozeny, and Jennifer Heins in Senator Grassley's \\noffice, and an entire team of outstanding staff.\\n  Thanks are also due to the Republican Whip, Senator Cornyn, and his \\nexcellent team, led by Monica Popp, and also to all of the dedicated \\nfloor staff who make this body function: Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and \\nthe entire cloakroom team; the Secretary of the Senate, \\nParliamentarians, clerks, reporters of debates, Sergeant at Arms, and \\nour doorkeepers.\\n  On my own team, I really cannot imagine this process--or really, my \\noffice, at all--without the crucial leadership of Sharon Soderstrom, my \\nchief of\\n\\n[[Page S6705]]\\n\\nstaff. She works harder and achieves more, under more pressure, than \\nalmost anyone I have ever had the privilege of working with.\\n  Don Stewart, my deputy chief of staff, is the expert hand who helps \\nkeep us on course and shapes our communications strategy. Hazen \\nMarshall, my policy director, helped to keep this and other priorities \\non track, including the other bipartisan policy wins the Senate \\ndelivered during the nomination debate.\\n  John Abegg is my chief counsel and right-hand man for every step of \\nthis process. For 15 weeks, John poured his determination, his \\nexperience, and his wisdom into this process. He started working the \\nmoment Justice Kennedy announced he was stepping down and did not stop \\nuntil the gavel fell. We wouldn't be here without his work.\\n  I am grateful to my policy advisers, my communications team, and my \\noperations staff for all the hard work and late nights they poured into \\nthis process, and to Phil Maxson and my personal office team for their \\nassistance.\\n  But most important of all, I need to close with this. To the men and \\nwomen of the United States Capitol Police and to all of the other law \\nenforcement officers who kept Members, staff, and citizens safe, even \\nin extremely difficult and often hostile circumstances, we really can't \\nthank them enough. Our representative government and the rule of law \\ndepend on their dedication, their bravery, and their sacrifice. So \\nthank you so much for keeping the Senate safe.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, it was good to get back home to Texas over \\nthe weekend and on Columbus Day. I had a chance to travel to far West \\nTexas, out to El Paso, TX, and catch up with some of my friends and \\nconstituents there on some important issues they care an awful lot \\nabout.\\n  While we in Washington have been focused on Brett Kavanaugh's \\nconfirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court for the last 90 days or so, a \\nlot of other important things have been happening back in Texas and \\naround the country.\\n  For example, on August 1, Dr. Jim Allison, affiliated with the \\nUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, won the Nobel \\nPrize in medicine, along with a researcher from Japan. This is really \\nimportant work. It was a culmination of 25 years of effort, and I am \\nsure something Jim would have never even dreamed of as he grew up in \\nthe small town of Alice, TX, 45 minutes from Corpus Christi. He has \\ncome a long way since then. We are very proud of him, and today we send \\nour congratulations to Dr. Allison and to the entire MD Anderson team \\non a tremendous accomplishment.\\n  Dr. Allison developed a new way to treat cancer using T cells. His \\nmethod unleashes a patient's immune system to attack tumors. In other \\nwords, it is your own immune system that is triggered to attack the \\ntumors that are attacking the patient. This is called immune checkpoint \\ntherapy. It has resulted in the development of numerous drugs that have \\nthe potential to save lives. None other than our former President, \\nJimmy Carter, is now cancer free because of this type of therapy, but \\nhe is just one of the most famous of many examples.\\n  In the not so distant past, cancer could be treated in only one of \\nthree ways: through surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. A friend of \\nmine gave me the book--I think it was a Pulitzer Prize winning book--\\ncalled ``The Emperor of All Maladies,'' which was also a documentary. \\nTo be honest, the way that the medical profession treated cancer in the \\nearly days was pretty primitive: surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. \\nBut now, thanks to people like Dr. Allison and MD Anderson, cancer \\npatients have other options.\\n  Dr. Allison is sometimes referred to as the ``Godfather of cancer \\nimmunotherapy,'' and the drugs he has helped to develop have now been \\napproved to treat not only melanoma and lung cancer but also Hodgkins \\nlymphoma and cancers of the kidney, bladder, liver and stomach.\\n  But despite the great strides made by this Nobel Prize-winning Texan, \\nimmunotherapy is still in the very early stages of development. Dr. \\nAllison said there are nearly 2,000 immunotherapy trials in progress \\naround the Nation, including 200 at MD Anderson alone. That gives my \\ncolleagues an idea of the number of people and the ongoing efforts that \\nare working to extend the scientific frontiers of cancer treatment.\\n  Much of this work, of course, would not be possible without the \\nfunding that is provided by the American taxpayer through State and \\nFederal funding. The National Institutes of Health remains the largest \\nfunding mechanism, but in Texas we have done our part by investing $3 \\nbillion over 10 years through the Cancer Prevention and Research \\nInstitute of Texas, commonly known as CPRIT.\\n  Here in the Senate and in the House, working together with the \\nadministration, we have been promoting cancer research in several \\noverlapping ways. I recently met with Dr. Shanlin Shah and learned \\nabout the fascinating proton therapy that MD Anderson has pioneered. \\nConversations like that are a great way that we in Congress, who are \\nobviously not experts, can try to stay on top of rapidly advancing \\nresearch.\\n  But even more important is what we do here collectively to fund that \\nresearch. We have increased funding by $2 billion to the National \\nInstitutes of Health. With that increase, close to $6 billion is now \\ngoing to the National Cancer Institute, and an additional $100 million \\nis being put toward the so-called Cancer Moonshot that Joe Biden and \\nothers touted and which all of us working together voted to create. The \\nMoonshot will accelerate research regarding high mortality cancers.\\n  As a part of the Moonshot initiative, the National Institutes of \\nHealth has partnered with biopharmaceutical companies to launch what is \\nknown as the Partnership for Accelerating Cancer or PACT, as it is \\ncalled. PACT is a 5-year public-private research collaboration totaling \\n$215 million. Hopefully, it will identify new biomarkers and develop \\nnew immunotherapy treatments.\\n  Dr. Allison, whom I mentioned earlier, has spoken about how crucial \\nthis government funding effort really is. Of course, like I said, while \\nwe are caught up in the fights of the day here on the floor of the \\nSenate, a lot of good work gets done that the American people don't \\nhear about. So that is why it is so important to emphasize this point.\\n  While biotech and pharmaceutical companies fund the late-stage \\nresearch that brings well-developed therapies into clinical trials, the \\nearly funding of basic science, which makes that possible, often comes \\nfrom the money provided by the U.S. Government through the National \\nInstitutes of Health. Without it, Dr. Allison said, ``many of the \\ntherapies that currently treat millions of cancer patients worldwide \\nsimply wouldn't exist.''\\n  That is an important point too. It is not just treating cancer here \\nin America. The science and the developments, the research and the \\ncures that are developed at places like MD Anderson Hospital in \\nHouston, TX, benefit the whole world.\\n  I remember one of the last times I was at MD Anderson for a townhall \\nmeeting with Senator McConnell, the majority leader, and Senator John \\nMcCain, our recently departed colleague from Arizona. At the time, I \\nwas told that patients from 90 different countries come to MD Anderson \\nin Houston, TX, because of their expertise treating cancer.\\n  So this is not just a local or national phenomenon. This is a \\nworldwide phenomenon.\\n  It is not just the government, of course, that helps to fund this \\nimportant research. Philanthropists are also invaluable when it comes \\nto this sort of research as well. I am thinking about my friends Peggy \\nand Lowry Mays of San Antonio, TX. Thanks to their generosity, San \\nAntonio's premier cancer center, which is one of only four in Texas \\nwith the National Cancer Institute's elite designation, is entering \\ninto an entirely new era. Their donations and their generosity will \\nprovide an endowment to support the director of the cancer center, and \\nit will also fund new faculty recruitment and retention initiatives for \\ngenerations to come. This is just another way\\n\\n[[Page S6706]]\\n\\nthat generous people with big hearts are making a difference. It is not \\njust government. It is government working together with people like the \\nMays to get these things done.\\n  What all of this shows, of course, is that when serious and sustained \\neffort is applied and money is invested, there is a lot of progress \\nthat we can make in dealing with things that never would have even been \\nconsidered treatable years earlier, not that many years ago, and there \\nis always more to be learned.\\n  This calls to mind something the great Thomas Edison, the inventor of \\nthe light bulb, once said: ``When you have exhausted all possibilities, \\nremember this--you haven't.'' We haven't exhausted all possibilities, \\nas Dr. Allison's path-breaking work clearly shows--not even close. We \\nhave so much more to discover and understand. With science advancing at \\npractically lightning speed, I believe it is not a question of if we \\ncure cancer but when.\\n  That comes as good news for families all across this country of ours \\nbecause almost no family has been spared. Even when we don't have a \\nclose friend or immediate family member who has undergone radiation \\ntreatment or chemotherapy, we know stories of famous people, such as \\nSteve Jobs, Aretha Franklin, and even our friend John McCain, recently \\ndeparted. They passed away from pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. For \\nothers we know, it was oral cancer or lung cancer. Cancer respects no \\npersons and observes no differences between the wealthy and the poor or \\nrace or ethnicity. But if we are lucky, we are also blessed to know \\ncancer survivors who, thanks to medical innovation, have a new shot at \\nlife. They have undergone hardships and treatment that the rest of us \\nmight find difficult to even imagine, but they have endured by their \\nspirit, and they have inspired all of us to keep working, whether it be \\nat the Mays Cancer Center in San Antonio, at MD Anderson in Houston, or \\nup here in Washington, where we work to fund research through \\nlegislation. Like Thomas Edison said, we will never exhaust all of the \\npossibilities, so we must not give up. We must keep trying.\\n  Working with generous donors, as well as undaunted scientific \\nresearchers like Dr. Allison and his team, I hope we will continue to \\napply our time and talents to finding answers and yielding newer and \\ngreater discoveries.\\n  To all the younger generations--some in towns not unlike Alice, TX--\\nto all of those who are wondering what they might want to be when they \\ngrow up, look no further than Dr. Jim Allison. Look how much he has \\naccomplished through his life's work. He is a good example of the type \\nof person you can aspire to be and what is possible if you try.\\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something \\nthat is such an urgent challenge for our Nation and the world; that is, \\nclimate change. Over the weekend, we received the most recent and most \\ndire warning of the costs of inaction yesterday when the U.N. \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its report. It wasn't \\neasy to break through the news in the last week. We all know there was \\na lot going on, but this one did.\\n  Why did this break through the news? First of all, it was such a \\ncomprehensive report. It was a product of 91 scientists from 40 \\ncountries. They looked at more than 6,000 studies, and they concluded, \\nabsent major changes in our greenhouse gas emissions, the devastating \\nconsequences of climate change are coming much sooner than previously \\nexpected. I think that is why it made front page news--because of the \\ntimeline.\\n  I think a lot of times people think of something that maybe their \\ngrandkids or great-grandkids are going to have to deal with, but, no, \\nactually the pages in this room--young people today, people even in my \\ngeneration--are going to have to be dealing directly with the frontline \\nconsequences of climate change.\\n  The report predicted that the atmosphere will warm up by as much as \\n2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040. That is just \\nover 20 years. Think about the pages in this room. Twenty years from \\nnow might seem long, but it is not that long at all.\\n  Just 20 years ago, we could see persistent droughts--we are already \\nseeing a number of droughts now--food shortages, worsening wildfires--\\nthink of what we have already seen in Colorado and California on the \\nwest coast--and increased coastal flooding, damage that could cost $54 \\ntrillion. This is about loss of life, loss of quality of life, and this \\nis about loss of money and loss of people's incomes.\\n  As the authors of the report make clear, it will take immediate \\naction to avoid these catastrophic consequences for our country and our \\nworld. First, by 2030, we must reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 45 \\npercent from 2010 levels. Second, by 2050, we must increase our use of \\nrenewable energy, such as wind and solar, by as much as 47 percent.\\n  Do you know what? We can do this. If we don't do anything, we are \\ngoing to face dire consequences.\\n  When I first came to the Senate, we started hearing from military \\npeople and from scientists from all over the world about what we could \\nsee even in the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. So much of that has \\nalready come true. Imagine if we do nothing, and we keep on this \\ntrajectory.\\n  The American people understand it. I hear about the climate issue \\neverywhere I go in my State--from hunters in Northern Minnesota to \\npeople who like to snowmobile and cross-country ski, to business \\nleaders in the Port of Duluth, to students at the University of \\nMinnesota.\\n  Increasingly, warmer temperatures are having dramatic effects all \\nover the northern part of our country. Lyme disease has spread further \\nnorth. Aspen forests are shrinking. Moose range is declining. There is \\nthirty-seven percent more rainfall as a result of mega rainstorms than \\nwe saw 50 years ago. The ragweed pollen season has extended 3 weeks in \\nthe Twin Cities in just the past 20 years. Those are facts.\\n  When you think about the effect that has on animals, think about the \\neffect that has on our daily lives, and then think about what would \\nhappen if we kept going that way, not just this way but that way in the \\nnext 20 years. This is in stark contrast to comments made by some who \\nstill suggest the climate change debate isn't settled. I couldn't \\ndisagree more.\\n  I know we had a vote in this Chamber where something like 98 or 99 \\nSenators voted that climate change is occurring. There may not be \\nagreement on what we should do about it, but there better be soon.\\n  I am a former prosecutor, so I believe in evidence. As this U.N. \\nreport shows us, the facts and the science couldn't be clearer. I \\nsuggest that everyone read about it or read summaries, which are easily \\navailable. Every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage \\nclimate change is already causing, and Americans will feel the \\nconsequences.\\n  My State may be miles and miles away from rising oceans, but the \\nimpacts are not less of a real threat to my State. Climate change isn't \\njust about melting glaciers, although we sure have seen those. Anyone \\nwho visits Glacier National Park--I went with my family--can literally \\nsee over time, decade by decade, the changes to those glaciers. I once \\nvisited Greenland with a number of Senators, including Republican \\nSenators, and you could see what is happening there as major icebergs \\nand parts of their ice sheets are breaking off and disappearing. You \\ncan see the physical evidence of this. You can see the photographs of \\nthis. It is not just about that.\\n  Recently, we have seen the devastating impact of natural disasters, \\nlike Hurricane Florence and the catastrophic flooding this summer \\nthroughout Southern Minnesota in Duluth. There may be some political \\ndivision around climate change; that is putting it mildly. But there \\nisn't any real scientific division because nearly all of the scientists \\nin this world believe this is happening.\\n  I will never forget an episode from the John Oliver show, which is a \\nhumorous program to watch, but it brings\\n\\n[[Page S6707]]\\n\\nreal issues to light. To show that kind of scientific division, he \\ndecided to have a bunch of scientists on the stage with him. They were \\nwearing their white coats. He had something like 97 or 98 scientists on \\none side in their white coats and 1 or 2 on the other side. That is the \\ndivision. It is not real division if you are someone who believes in \\nevidence. Climate change is occurring, and this latest report is from \\nthe scientists all over the world who would have no reason to do this \\nexcept to warn people about the truth. That is why they are doing this.\\n  As citizens, we have an obligation to learn about it, to understand \\nit, and to support ideas that will not hold us back dramatically but \\nwill allow us to tackle this head-on. If we don't tackle this issue, we \\nare going to continue to struggle with the far-reaching economic and \\nenvironmental consequences. This report makes clear that those risks \\naren't far off in the future for your great-great-great-great-great-\\ngreat grandchildren; no, they could become a crisis as soon as 2040.\\n  Shifting global trends have the potential to wreak more subtle, long-\\nterm havoc on our businesses and industries. That is why so many \\nbusinesses in my State support doing something about climate change. \\nSometimes it is because they have customers all over the world--all \\nover the world in areas that are going to be the first hit by tsunamis \\nand other weather events or it is because they simply want to be good \\ncorporate citizens or it is because they see their bottom line and how \\nit is going to be affected if we don't do something about this.\\n  The U.N. report details the economic damage that will happen if we \\nfail to act, including losses of roughly 1.2 percent to our gross \\ndomestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warning. As it gets hotter, \\nthe GDP does go down.\\n  As a Senator from a State with a strong agricultural industry and a \\ntradition of hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and skiing, climate change \\nis not only a direct threat to our State's economy, it is also a threat \\nto our quality of life, to the way we grew up, to enjoying the outdoors \\nwith our friends and our families.\\n  When President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw \\nfrom the international climate change agreement last summer, I heard a \\nlot from people in our State.\\n  As you all know, 195 countries made a pledge to come together to \\ncombat climate change, and in withdrawing, the United States was \\ninitially one of only three countries that would not be in the \\nagreement. The other two countries that weren't in the agreement were \\nSyria and Nicaragua. Well, now Syria and Nicaragua have signed the \\naccord, so the United States is now the only country not to sign the \\naccord.\\n  Our decision to leave this agreement sent the wrong message to the \\nrest of the world--the wrong message. The lack of leadership has led to \\nother countries discussing backing out of the agreement. That is not \\nleadership. That is not leading from the front. We can't have this \\nhappen. America should be leading and helping the world move forward.\\n  By the way, there is such an innovation space here, so much money to \\nbe made by responding to this in a smart way and developing new \\nvehicles and developing new energy and new ways to deal with this \\nchallenge. It isn't just a challenge; it is also an opportunity. If we \\ndon't seize that opportunity by getting our own act together, by \\nadmitting that it is a problem and giving incentives to our businesses \\nto go in the right direction and to bring other countries with us, we \\nare going to lose that opportunity to other countries that are part of \\nthis international coalition.\\n  I have already talked to people who work in government or who work \\nfor businesses that have gone to international meetings and who have \\nsaid: Do you know what some of these people in other countries say? I \\nthink we are going to work with China on this. They are part of that \\nagreement. Hey, we are going to buy our solar panels from them, or we \\nare going to do work with them on this.\\n  You can't hide from the fact that we withdrew from that agreement, \\nand it hurts not just our environment, it hurts our economic \\nopportunities going forward.\\n  Look at Minnesota and what has happened because we were out front on \\nthis. I am proud that our State has taken an incredibly proactive and \\ninnovative approach to energy use and sustainability, which is critical \\nto addressing carbon emissions. Our State's renewable energy standard \\nrequires that 25 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources \\nby 2025. We passed that way back in 2007 with--get this--a Republican \\nGovernor, Governor Pawlenty. He helped lead the way on that and worked \\nwith the legislature of Democrats and Republicans to pass what was at \\nthe time seen as a very aggressive standard. We did it by combining it \\nwith doing something about biofuels--something that is important not \\njust in Minnesota but in the Presiding Officer's State of North Dakota.\\n  We were able to put together that kind of coalition--the leaders in \\nour legislature and the Governor, farmers and workers, \\nenvironmentalists--to move forward on biofuels so we would have \\ndiversity in our fuel supply as well as diversity in our energy supply. \\nSo we don't rely on just one type of energy, and we reduce greenhouse \\ngases by having an ``all of the above'' energy approach.\\n  The legislation back then in 2007 received overwhelming bipartisan \\nsupport, passing the Minnesota House 123 to 10 and the Minnesota Senate \\n63 to 3. It has been a while since we have reached that kind of \\nconsensus on the Federal level when it comes to energy.\\n  What has happened? We have more than met those goals. What has \\nhappened nationally? Well, there was progress made during the Obama \\nadministration. When I first got here in 2007, I personally thought \\nthat we should move to some kind of a renewable electricity standard \\nfor the whole country, maybe making differences by geographic areas and \\nregions. Sadly, the decision was not made to go that way. I think we \\nlost it by one vote. We lost it by one vote. Instead, the decision was \\nmade on one side that we wanted to be more aggressive--and we tried \\nwith cap and trade, but that didn't end up getting passed in the \\nSenate--and then on the other side, to kind of say: Well, let's just \\nsee what happens. As a result, in my mind, we have not done nearly \\nenough.\\n  What has happened instead? Well, the States, our laboratories of \\ndemocracy, have moved ahead--many of them, like Minnesota--and are \\ncoming up with their own standards or doing it by region. Our \\nuniversities have moved ahead, our cities have moved ahead, and our \\nbusinesses have moved ahead. By 2015, 154 companies, including \\ncompanies I am very proud of--major companies in my State, such as \\nTarget, Best Buy, General Mills, and Cargill--had signed a pledge \\ndemonstrating their support for action on climate change that takes a \\nstrong step toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. These companies \\ncollectively employ more than 9 million people and represent more than \\n$3 trillion in annual revenue.\\n  Last month at the Alliance to Save Energy gala, I got to present an \\nEnergy Efficiency Award to Target because of the work they have done \\nwith sustainability and righting the impacts of climate change. They \\nhave created an electric car program that is up and running in 5 \\nStates, and they plan to expand that number to 20 in the next 2 years. \\nThey signed a virtual power purchase agreement with the Stephens Ranch \\nwind farm in Texas as part of their goal of sourcing 100 percent \\nrenewable energy in their U.S. operations. Like so many companies in \\nthe United States, they have started a major solar program and are \\ncommitted to establishing rooftop solar panels on 500 of their stores \\nby 2020. As of last year, they had already finished 436 of their \\nprojects.\\n  They are not alone. Xcel Energy, Minnesota's largest utility, was an \\nearly supporter of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.\\n  If we had allowed that to go through and had that in place, imagine \\nwhat a better position we would be in when we read headlines like those \\nfrom this morning about the U.N.'s report and the dire predictions of \\nwhat we are going to see in 20 years. But, no, we are in what I \\nconsider a state of paralysis. Maybe we are not making things worse, \\nalthough when we took away those gas mileage standards--when the \\nadministration went back on that--we made them worse. We sure aren't \\nmaking them better. Thanks to cities and\\n\\n[[Page S6708]]\\n\\nStates, we are making progress, but we should be doing this together as \\na nation.\\n  Xcel Energy is another example of a company that appears to be ahead \\nof the Federal Government. They supported the Obama administration's \\nClean Power Plan and announced plans to reduce carbon emissions by 60 \\npercent in the next 15 years.\\n  I look at it this way: If companies like Target and Xcel Energy \\nunderstand the need to reduce our use of fossil fuels and embrace the \\nenergy of the future, then so should Members of Congress, and so should \\nthis administration.\\n  We know that energy innovation can't take root--not in any serious \\nway--without certainty and stability on what those incentives are. That \\nis what that Clean Power Plan was about. It took what I considered a \\nmore moderate route than some people thought it was going to take, but \\nthen it got pulled back by this administration. It is very hard to \\nstart planning for the future if we don't have a route for these \\ncompanies to go. The rest of the world is getting on board. We don't \\nwant to be following; we want to be leading in America.\\n\\n  As this week's report made clear, inaction is not an option for our \\neconomy, for our environment, for our country, or for the world. \\nMilitary and security experts have repeatedly reminded us that climate \\nchange is a threat to our national security, increasing risks of \\nconflict, humanitarian crisis, and damage to critical infrastructure.\\n  We see the stories of some of the refugees who are not coming up from \\nconflict but are coming up from parts of Africa where they used to do \\nsubsistence farming but can no longer do that kind of subsistence \\nfarming because it is too dry, there are too many droughts, and the \\nworld has changed. We are going to see these humongous movements of \\npeople because they can't live where they used to live.\\n  It is much better for us if we take this on as a world and do \\nsomething about it than deal with the repercussions of it--more severe \\nweather, heat waves that could reduce our water supply, extreme \\nrainfall that could damage critical infrastructure, and a decrease in \\nagricultural productivity that could threaten my State's $20 billion \\nagricultural industry. People around the country understand the stakes, \\nbut this place--I think it needs just a little more imagination.\\n  If you ever visit my office, I have a picture on the wall, and it is \\na picture of an angel, and she is handing off the world to some \\noutstretched hands. The words on the picture read: ``The angel \\nshrugged, and she said, `If we fail this time, it will be a failure of \\nimagination.' '' That is what we need right now in Washington, DC--\\nimagination to deal with a very clear threat that the scientists have \\nput right in front of us. Twenty years from now, it is going to be \\nworse than those wildfires we see raging in California and Colorado. \\nTwenty years from now, it is going to be worse than what we are seeing \\nwhen it comes to the hurricanes and the tsunamis and all of the \\nicebergs melting and what we are seeing in our national parks. Why \\nwould we just let this happen? We are America. We are leaders. It is \\ntime to act.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, well, now that the Senate has concluded \\nits very divisive debate about the Supreme Court, it is time to talk \\nabout the No. 1 issue to the American people: healthcare. We begin that \\ndebate tomorrow, when the Senate will take up a Democratic motion to \\nrepeal the Trump administration's effort to expand short-term insurance \\nplans.\\n  Let me be clear. These so-called short-term plans are junk insurance. \\nShort-term plans are junk insurance. People who buy them are going to \\nbe extremely disappointed because they bait the consumer in with low \\nprices but hardly cover anything. They might not cover maternity care, \\nmental health care, prescription drugs--you name it. Even worse, the \\nplans draw consumers out of the health insurance market, making it more \\nexpensive for everyone else to purchase insurance, especially more \\nexpensive for those with preexisting conditions.\\n  That is why so many prominent patient and consumer groups have filed \\na lawsuit against the administration's rule to expand these junk plans. \\nGroups like the American Cancer Society, the AARP, the Lung \\nAssociation, the Diabetes Association, and others that represent \\nmillions of Americans with preexisting conditions have clearly said \\nthat this is sabotage--sabotage--of the insurance market and will drive \\nup costs for millions of Americans.\\n  So Senator Baldwin has introduced a CRA disapproval resolution--a \\nresolution brought under the Congressional Review Act--to repeal this \\nfundamentally misguided policy from the Trump administration. All of my \\ncolleagues should vote for this, but I suspect my colleagues on the \\nother side of the aisle have a different idea because ever since taking \\ncontrol of Congress and the Presidency, Republicans have deliberately, \\nrelentlessly undermined Americans' healthcare.\\n  This particular policy is part of a long campaign to sabotage our \\nhealthcare system. Remember, nearly every Republican was silent when \\nPresident Trump canceled the program that helped low-income Americans \\nafford insurance. Remember, every Republican was silent when President \\nTrump directed his administration to stop helping Americans sign up for \\nthe right policy. Remember, nearly every Republican was silent when \\nPresident Trump's Justice Department refused to defend protections for \\npreexisting conditions. A large number of Republican attorneys \\ngeneral--some running for the Senate right now--were part of the Trump \\nadministration's efforts to say it is just fine to get rid of \\nprotections for those with preexisting conditions. Remember, nearly \\nevery Republican voted to gut Medicaid, raise premiums on older \\nAmericans, repeal protections for Americans with preexisting \\nconditions, and move us toward a future where 20 million fewer \\nAmericans have healthcare. Remember, every single Republican voted to \\nrepeal the coverage requirement and cause premiums to be much higher \\nthis year than they needed to be.\\n\\n  So Americans, when you are paying more for insurance and you hate it, \\nwhen those deductibles go up, those copayments go up, and you say: \\nWhere is the insurance that was supposed to protect me? I have taken so \\nmuch money out of my own pocket. It is hardly worth it. Look to the \\nother side of the aisle, and look at what your Senators have done, if \\nyou come from a State where they represent you. As a result of the \\nRepublican sabotage, premiums are up, out-of-pocket costs are up, \\nprescription drug costs are up, and the quality of insurance is down--\\nin many cases way down. Under this Republican President and this \\nRepublican Congress, Americans are paying more to get lower quality \\nhealth insurance. Americans, under this President, this Congress, are \\npaying more to get less when it comes to health insurance.\\n  Protections for preexisting conditions are under assault in so many \\ndifferent ways. No wonder why, in poll after poll, Americans put \\nhealthcare as the No. 1 issue in the upcoming election. Tomorrow the \\nSenate will have an opportunity to undo a portion of the Republican \\ncampaign to sabotage healthcare.\\n  In November, the American people will have a golden opportunity to \\nmove our country in a dramatically different direction by voting for \\nDemocratic candidates who will work to improve our healthcare rather \\nthan so many of those Republican candidates who, in obeisance to the \\nbig insurance companies, work to destroy it.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson).

       " \"Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Barrasso, \\nRanking Member Carper, and Senators Inhofe and Cardin for all their \\nhard work to advance the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 to \\nthe Senate\\n\\n[[Page S6709]]\\n\\nfloor so we can make the much needed improvements to our Nation's water \\ninfrastructure. I would also like to express my appreciation to the \\nhard-working staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee who \\nspent literally countless hours working on this important water \\ninfrastructure legislation. The path to getting this bill to the Senate \\nfloor has not been easy, and it would not have happened without the \\nstrong bipartisanship shown by EPW leaders.\\n  This bill gets us back on track to authorize critical water \\ninfrastructure projects across the country every 2 years, ensuring our \\neconomic vitality and competitiveness. America's Water Infrastructure \\nAct is in lockstep with President Trump's vision for infrastructure by \\ngrowing our economy, cutting redtape, protecting our citizens and their \\nproperty, and improving transparency, all the while being fiscally \\nresponsible.\\n  I am particularly pleased, this bill also includes the Securing \\nRequired Funding for Water Infrastructure Now Act or SRF WIN Act \\nlegislation that I had an opportunity to introduce with Senator Booker. \\nThe SRF WIN Act was a truly bipartisan effort, and I would like to give \\nspecial thanks to our cosponsors, Senators Barrasso, Cornyn, Inhofe, \\nCapito, Wicker, Hyde-Smith, Feinstein, Casey, Baldwin, Manchin, and \\nSenator Whitehouse.\\n  The fact that the SRF WIN Act has cosponsors from across the country \\nwith vastly different political ideologies makes an important point \\nthat infrastructure investment is not a rural issue or a big city \\nissue. It is not a red State or blue State problem. This is a national \\nemergency, and it is time we put partisanship aside and show the \\nAmerican people we can work together to provide safe and reliable \\ndrinking water and wastewater services to Americans in every part of \\nthe country.\\n  The SRF WIN Act is a result of months-long negotiations. It blends \\nthe best ideas available to ensure this commonsense, bipartisan \\nlegislation will work effectively and efficiently, providing millions \\nand potentially billions in project dollars to communities that have \\ntraditionally not had access to these types of funds.\\n  What the SRF WIN Act does is simple. It combines the efficiency and \\ntrust associated with the State Revolving Funds with the leveraging \\npower of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. This \\nlegislation makes the process easier and more affordable for States and \\ncommunities to access Federal water infrastructure funding. Simply put, \\nthe SRF WIN Act is a critical component to future water infrastructure \\nfinancing.\\n  Congress needs to do a better job providing basic public services \\nsuch as safe roads, bridges, and an up-to-date water infrastructure \\nsystem. By passing America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, Congress \\nhas made water infrastructure investment a top priority. This bill is a \\nvictory for job creators, small and large businesses, every single \\nState across the country, and consumers. I am pleased to see support \\nfor this bill in the House, the Senate, and the White House.\\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation, and I again \\nthank Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, Senators Inhofe and \\nCardin for their strong bipartisan work. They set a great example of \\nthe good policy outcomes that can be accomplished if we work together.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, we receive a lot of letters in our \\noffices, and primarily we pay attention to those that come from our own \\nhome States. People expect me as their Senator to read the letter and \\nto at least consider their point of view. Some of these letters are \\nkind of routine, almost form letters. Some emails come in at a volume \\nwe can hardly keep up with. In Illinois, I receive 10,000 emails a \\nweek--a week. That is a lot.\\n  There was a time when I was a college kid working here on Capitol \\nHill, and the Senator from Illinois signed every letter that went out \\nof the office--sat at the desk and signed the letters. It is \\ninconceivable now that we can respond to all the letters each day. We \\ntry to keep up with them, we try to be timely, and we pick those \\nletters out that are personal and important enough that the staff \\nthinks I should read them personally, and I make a point of doing it.\\n  Sometimes the stories they tell give me an insight into the issues we \\ndebate on the floor of the Senate.\\n  Most of the time the American people look at us puzzled, asking: What \\nare they talking about, and why does this mean anything to my family \\nand my future?\\n  Let me give you an example of a couple of letters I received that \\nrelate to a vote we are going to take this week. The first letter was \\nfrom Richard and Mary Laidman, from Naperville, IL, which is west of \\nthe city of Chicago, in DuPage County.\\n  Richard and Mary wrote: ``Our 13-year-old son Sam was diagnosed with \\nleukemia one day after the `no pre-existing conditions exclusions for \\nkids' protection went into effect.''\\n  They went on to say to me: ``Obviously, we are feeling dependent on \\nall the clauses of the [ACA] right now--including [the] no pre-existing \\nconditions exclusions.''\\n  The bottom line, the Laidmans say, is ``junk insurance plans,'' the \\nones that are so cheap they don't cover anything important. ``Junk \\ninsurance plans'' wouldn't cover their son. It would leave him and the \\nfamily to fend for themselves in the individual market.\\n  Do you know what it is like to go into the individual market as a \\nmother and father and try to find health insurance for a 13-year-old \\nson who has been diagnosed with leukemia? Maybe you can't find any, but \\nif you could, it would be so expensive that you might not be able to \\nafford it. The Affordable Care Act changed that, and it said: If you \\nare going to offer health insurance plans in this country, you cannot \\ndiscriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions. You have to \\ncover everybody--bring them all in.\\n  We do that in Medicare. We say when you reach Medicare eligibility: \\nAll aboard. Everybody is invited in.\\n  But for the longest time, private health insurance companies wanted \\nto pick and choose. They wanted healthy people who can pay premiums. \\nThey would rather not pay these bills so they excluded a lot of people \\nwith preexisting conditions.\\n  Sam, age 13 and diagnosed with leukemia, would be one of the victims \\nof that old-time approach. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society recently \\nstated:\\n\\n       People diagnosed with cancer on a short term plan soon \\n     discover these plans fail to cover even lifesaving cancer \\n     treatments. If patients on short term plans can get access to \\n     cancer therapies at all, they will often be left with \\n     hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.\\n\\n  Tammy Baldwin is a Senator from the State of Wisconsin. She is going \\nto offer to the Senate tomorrow a chance to vote against President \\nTrump's plan that would eliminate protection for preexisting \\nconditions. We will get a chance to be on record here. I think it is \\nlong overdue.\\n  None of us knows what tomorrow will bring. We don't know if tomorrow \\nwill bring an accident or a diagnosis, and, all of a sudden, your \\nhappy, healthy family has a challenge you never dreamed of. It has \\nhappened to my family. I will bet it has happened to most of yours.\\n  The question is, Are we going to demand of health insurance companies \\nthat they cover those with preexisting conditions or are we just going \\nto tell those families: Fend for yourself. See what happens. See how \\nmuch it costs.\\n  Another letter is from Watseka, IL, from the McTaggart family. \\nWatseka is south of Chicago, in Iroquois County, a rural county, with \\nbig towns like Watseka and Milford. It is a great little place.\\n  Here is a letter from Christine McTaggart. She was originally \\ndiagnosed with stage III inflammatory breast cancer. Given this type of \\naggressive cancer, her prognosis was not\\n\\n[[Page S6710]]\\n\\ngood. She went through 16 cycles of chemo, a bilateral mastectomy, 33 \\nradiation treatments, failed reconstruction and chronic tissue issues, \\nand a thyroid cancer diagnosis. After all that, she learned the breast \\ncancer was back. This time she was stage IV. In her letter to me, \\nChristine said:\\n\\n       When the ACA became law, I had no idea that my life would \\n     come to depend on policies such as pre-existing conditions \\n     not excluding you from coverage.\\n\\n  She ends with this quote:\\n\\n       I thank you for your tireless advocacy on this issue. . . . \\n     My life, literally, depends on it.\\n\\n  We pass a lot of resolutions here for ``National Pickle Week'' and \\nsaluting the flag. All of that is part of my job. Occasionally, an \\nissue comes to the floor of the Senate that is really going to affect \\nlife-and-death issues for Americans all across our Nation. This is one \\nof them. This is the No. 1 issue in this election.\\n  You might think our debate last week about a Supreme Court Justice \\nwas important, but you ask families back in Illinois: What do you \\nreally care about?\\n  They say: Senator, that was an important debate. I care about my \\nfamily. I care about my health insurance. I want to make sure of two \\nthings. I want to make sure I can afford it, and I want to make sure \\nthat when I buy it, it is worth owning and it is there when I need it.\\n  The Republican view on this is this: Buyer beware. Go out in the \\nmarketplace. Shop around. Buy yourself something cheap, like a junk \\ninsurance plan. It may not be there when you need it, but boy, the \\npremiums will be low.\\n  That is not much confidence in insurance, if that is the case, and \\nthat is why, when Tammy Baldwin, Senator of Wisconsin, offers us a \\nchance to vote--I think, as soon as tomorrow--on this Trump rule, I \\nhope we will get at least two Republicans who cross the aisle and join \\nus. If they are listening at home, they will, because if they are \\nlistening at home, they know that families really care about this issue \\nof preexisting conditions. It is so important for us.\\n  You look at the groups that have come out in opposition to President \\nTrump's junk insurance plans. They are the most important groups that \\nyou could think of. The American Cancer Society stated that President \\nTrump's junk plan rule would ``leave older and sicker Americans in the \\nindividual market with few, if any, affordable health coverage \\nchoices'' and that ``patients living with serious conditions will be \\nleft paying more for the coverage they need, if they can afford \\ncoverage at all.\\n  In recent months, I have heard a lot of congressional Republicans \\nproclaim to care about people with preexisting conditions, especially \\nthose up for reelection. These are the same ones who have eagerly voted \\nto repeal the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the night.\\n  I have been in the Senate for a few years. That was one vote I will \\nnever forget. John McCain walked through those doors in the middle of \\nthe night, stood at that table, and with his arms still restricted \\nbecause of the torture he went through as a veteran in the Vietnam war, \\nhe could barely lift his right arm with his thumb pointed down, saying \\nno. That ``no'' vote, together with two other Republicans, saved health \\ninsurance coverage for millions of Americans.\\n  But the Trump administration isn't finished. They found new ways to \\nreduce coverage for American families and to raise costs. That is what \\nthe Trump plan is all about, and that is what we get a chance to vote \\non.\\n  The Senate is broken out in 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. If all \\nof the Democrats vote for Tammy Baldwin, and I think they will, we \\nstill need two Republicans. Let's see if they will come over and vote \\nnot only against the Trump plan but vote for the millions of families \\nlike those who I have read about today on the floor who are counting on \\nquality health insurance to be there when they need it, who believe \\nthat no one should discriminate against someone because of a \\npreexisting health condition. That, to me, seems fundamentally fair.\\n  I have raised a child with a serious problem. We face this time and \\nagain. Nobody should have to face it. A vote for Tammy Baldwin's \\nresolution of disapproval on the Trump plan tomorrow will put America \\non the right course for families that need health insurance they can \\ncount on.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Water Resources \\nDevelopment Act, the cloture motion of which we will be voting on very \\nshortly. I strongly support moving forward with this legislation, and I \\nencourage this body's support of that important work.\\n  I begin by thanking Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and \\nSenator Inhofe for their great work on this bill. On the Environment \\nand Public Works Committee, we have the leadership of Senator Barrasso \\nand Senator Carper, and on the subcommittee that deals with \\ninfrastructure, I work with Senator Inhofe. The four of us have worked \\nvery closely in, I think, the best traditions of the Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee in the U.S. Senate in order to bring forward \\nlegislation that really does represent the priorities of all 100 \\nMembers of the U.S. Senate.\\n  From the beginning, I acknowledge the amount of work that was done in \\norder to accomplish this. It was done in great measure by incredibly \\ngifted staff people who have been working for a long period of time in \\norder to bring this bill to completion. Obviously, there are rough \\nedges, and there are problems that require a lot of negotiations. Yet I \\nknow that Senator Barrasso, Senator Carper, and Senator Inhofe will \\nagree with me about the importance of our staffs' work.\\n  I acknowledge Mae Stevens of my staff for the work she has done on \\nthis legislation to advance the priorities that are important for the \\npeople of Maryland and to make sure we have a well-balanced bill for \\nour country.\\n  As I think my colleagues know, the focal point of my environmental \\nwork has been to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay, which is \\nconsidered to be one of America's greatest natural resources and is a \\nnational treasure. The Chesapeake Bay is the Nation's largest estuary. \\nIt generates $1 trillion in economic benefit to the watershed region. \\nThe Chesapeake Bay is critically important with regard to who we are as \\na region, our quality of life, our economy, and because of its rich \\nenvironmental treasures.\\n  The shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries stretch \\nover 2,000 miles. More than 100,000 streams and rivers and thousands of \\nacres of wetlands provide the freshwater that flows into the Chesapeake \\nBay. If we do not protect the health of this incredible network of \\nwaters, we cannot hope to restore the Chesapeake Bay to its former \\nglory.\\n  Additionally, the effort to clean up and restore the bay creates new \\njobs and economic growth opportunities around the bay States. For \\nexample, work to repair and upgrade our urban and suburban wastewater \\nand stormwater systems puts people to work as engineers and operators, \\nand there are so many more jobs that are created.\\n  Although we are making great strides in improving the quality of the \\nChesapeake Bay--I am very pleased of the progress we have made, and I \\nthink you see that when you visit the Inner Harbor of Baltimore or our \\nshorelines--we still have a long way to go.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 supports the health of the \\nChesapeake Bay. In doing so, it helps our Nation's economic \\ncompetitiveness, our environment, and the health and welfare of our \\ncitizens. In particular, I am pleased that America's Water \\nInfrastructure Act of 2018 will help both Poplar Island and the Mid-Bay \\nproject to continue what is a win-win for both the Baltimore Harbor and \\nthe Chesapeake Bay. Both of these projects are located in the State of \\nMaryland. Both are critically important for us to maintain the \\nenvironment and economy of the Chesapeake Bay.\\n\\n[[Page S6711]]\\n\\n  I have seen firsthand the results of the U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers' efforts around the State. The Corps' ingenuity and expertise \\nhave spearheaded the replenishing and expansion of Poplar Island in the \\nChesapeake Bay. This massive sustainability project is quite literally \\nbringing life to our region in its restoration of a habitat which for \\nyears suffered from erosion and environmental degradation.\\n  We are taking Poplar Island, which used to exist in the Chesapeake \\nBay but had been down to just a few acres, and restoring it in an \\nenvironmental restoration project. We are bringing back wildlife and \\nspecies diversification into the Chesapeake Bay. At the same time, it \\nis a location for dredged materials. I can tell you, in my having been \\nin Congress, it is not always easy to find locations to put dredged \\nmaterials. Poplar Island is also popular with the community, so it has \\nbeen a win-win-win situation.\\n  The expansion of the island now to 1,715 acres has the long-term \\nbenefit of creating a place for our native plants and animals to thrive \\nand the short-term benefit of efficiently utilizing dredged materials \\nfrom the maintenance of the Port of Baltimore to rebuild the island \\nbeyond its original footprint. We are now back up to over 1,700 acres \\nfrom just the few acres that existed not too many years ago. This \\ncreates a system that helps to improve the vitality of both our \\ntreasured ecosystem and our commercial waterways, and it sets a \\nprecedent for beneficial practices in the future.\\n  The Army Corps has collaborated with Federal and State agencies, \\nlocal communities, and businesses for input on this project, ensuring \\nthat its benefits will extend to all within the region.\\n  The Mid-Bay Project is a continuation of the very successful Poplar \\nIsland project, and I am pleased that both projects are supported in \\nthis bill. Poplar Island will reach its capacity in the next few years, \\nwhich is what we planned on. Yet, in order to make sure we have another \\nsite that is available, we have to move that project now so that the \\nplanning process can be completed in time and engineering work can be \\ncompleted in time so that there is no loss of activity in keeping the \\nharbors at the needed dredge levels for shipping and have a site where \\nthe dredged material can be located. That is why it is so critically \\nimportant to move forward with Mid-Bay now.\\n\\n  We need policies that will keep up with the demand of our \\ninfrastructure backlog while we address the needs of our communities \\nand our environment. We can and we must do both. I am pleased that \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 would help projects in the \\nAnacostia River watershed in Prince George's County get off the ground.\\n  This is the third WRDA bill in a row. Congress is including updates \\nto our Nation's drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater \\ninfrastructure, including much needed funding.\\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has yet again given our \\ndrinking water and wastewater a grade of D for 2016. States will need \\n$32.75 billion a year every year for the next 20 years just to get our \\ninfrastructure in working order, which is more than $1 trillion. Yet we \\nare currently only spending about $2 billion per year on both the clean \\nwater and drinking water State revolving funds combined. Every \\ncommunity--urban, rural, and suburban neighborhoods--has a right to \\nexpect that water that comes from its tap is safe to drink and that \\nCongress will do everything within its power to ensure that it happens. \\nClean water means good jobs and better health throughout Maryland and \\nour Nation.\\n  Clean water is not a partisan issue, and I have been proud to work \\nwith my colleagues to develop legislation that will benefit our aging \\nwater resources and infrastructure. Congress has the responsibility to \\nbe a strong partner with States and localities to repair our Nation's \\nhidden water infrastructure and open waterways and to always remain \\nunwavering in our commitment to improve the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\\n  One of the problems is that a lot of our water infrastructure is \\nhidden. You don't see it, but you sure do notice it if you don't get \\nclean water to drink, and you sure notice it when it affects the water \\nquality of the bay or of other critical waters in this country. We \\nreally need to pay attention to this. We need to increase our capacity \\nto be a partner in modernizing our water infrastructure, and this \\nlegislation absolutely takes a major step forward in carrying out that \\ncommitment.\\n  Let me talk about some of the specific provisions that are included \\nin this act.\\n  First, the bill includes S. 1137, the Clean Safe Reliable Water \\nInfrastructure Act, which was introduced by me and Senators Boozman, \\nInhofe, and Duckworth. It addresses the need to invest in our Nation's \\ndrinking water, sewer, and stormwater systems, and it provides for \\nincreased water efficiency.\\n  The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act specifically \\nincludes $450 million to protect the sources of our drinking water and \\nthe funding to repair and eliminate combined sewer overflows, which \\ndump water sewage into our Nation's waterways every time it rains. This \\nis especially timely as the Mid-Atlantic region has seen historic \\nprecipitation events increasingly in the last decade. These 100- or \\n1,000-year events cause wastewater treatment plants to take on more \\nwater than they can handle. Millions of gallons of untreated water are \\ndiverted into our local waterways--the same water that supplies our \\ndrinking water and the fish, crabs, and oysters that Marylanders love \\nto eat.\\n  In fact, there was a storm so massive in Frederick, MD, just a few \\nmonths ago that city officials asked residents to stop using the water \\nin order to prevent equipment failure at the wastewater treatment \\nplant. This is a crisis situation. This $450 million will go far toward \\nhelping to divert stormwater away from the wastewater treatment plant \\nin Frederick as well as those like it all over the State of Maryland \\nand our Nation.\\n  The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastructure Act also formally \\nauthorizes the voluntary WaterSense Program, which identifies and \\npromotes water-efficient products through voluntary labeling. The \\nWaterSense label makes it simple to find water-efficient products, new \\nhomes, and programs that meet the EPA's criteria for efficiency and \\nperformance. WaterSense-labeled products and services are certified to \\nuse at least 20-percent less water, save energy, and perform as well as \\nor better than regular models. The program should help individuals \\nreduce their water demand while protecting water quality. This benefits \\nall of us, as we save water, we save energy, and we save costs.\\n  The EPA's WaterSense Program partners with manufacturers, retailers, \\ndistributors, home builders, irrigation professionals, and utilities to \\nbring efficient products and services to our communities, and their \\npartnerships encourage innovation in manufacturing and support \\nsustainable jobs for American workers.\\n  Secondly, the WRDA bill creates a multi-agency Federal task force to \\nstudy the problem of funding and financing stormwater infrastructure. \\nThe task force will, with the feedback from State and local governments \\nand other program stakeholders, provide in a report to Congress \\nsuggestions for improving the funding and financing of stormwater \\nsystems--especially important as Maryland sees more frequent and severe \\nstorms, like the deadly floods in Ellicott City that were 22 months \\napart.\\n  I have already spoken on the Senate floor about what happened in \\nEllicott City, MD. Within 20 months, we had two 1,000-year floods. \\nThese floods were unprecedented. What do I mean by that? We have had \\nflooding in Ellicott City before because the water rises in the river \\nthat goes through Ellicott City. These are the first floods we have had \\nas a result of the stormwater runoff that literally ran down the main \\nstreets of Ellicott City. It destroyed homes and cost people their \\nlives.\\n  We need to deal with this. Stormwater pollution is not only an urgent \\nand deadly threat but a long-term one as well. Stormwater pollution is \\nthe fastest growing source of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. Yes, we \\ntalk about our farmers, and we have to do better for our farmers. We \\ntalk about the other problems we have, including the airborne \\npollutants that go into the Bay. But the fastest growing source in the \\nChesapeake Bay is storm runoff, which is a result of more people\\n\\n[[Page S6712]]\\n\\nliving in the community, a result of more concrete, and a result of \\nmore severe weather events.\\n  Third, the bill addresses the need for information about onsite \\nwastewater recycling as one alternative for communities that cannot \\nafford the upfront costs or ongoing maintenance costs of traditional \\nwastewater infrastructure. This is especially important in the rural \\nparts of my State, like Maryland's Eastern Shore.\\n  Fourth, the bill includes S. 451, the Water Resources Research \\nAmendments Act, introduced by me and Senator Boozman, which addresses \\nthe need for additional research into increasing the effectiveness and \\nefficiency of new and existing water treatment works. Funding from this \\nprogram helps to support the Maryland Water Resources Research Center \\nand the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the \\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park. We want to add the latest \\ntechnology. We want to be the best in the world, as far as technology, \\nwhen dealing with our water. This particular provision in the bill will \\nhelp us achieve those objectives.\\n  Fifth, the bill reauthorizes WIFIA, a low-cost financing mechanism \\nfor water infrastructure projects. We first started with WIFIA in our \\ntransportation bill, coming out of our Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee, where we found creative ways in order to leverage the \\nFederal participation so we can have larger infrastructure projects for \\nroads, transit, and bridges. Now we are doing the same with water \\ninfrastructure. This bill reauthorizes the WIFIA program.\\n  Baltimore is on the list to receive one of the very first low-\\ninterest WIFIA loans. Baltimore's $200 million loan will complete a set \\nof projects to repair, rehabilitate, replace, and upgrade its \\nwastewater collection and treatment, water treatment and distribution, \\nand storm water management systems.\\n  These projects will help to improve the city's sanitary sewer \\ncollection system, ensure the reliability and performance of the \\ndrinking water and wastewater systems, and improve storm water \\nmanagement to meet Clean Water Act permit requirements.\\n  This will help the 1.8 million people served by the Baltimore \\nDepartment of Public Works to continue to have some of the cleanest, \\nsafest, and most reliable drinking water in the country. There is no \\nmore fundamental responsibility of government than to make sure they \\nprovide safe drinking water to its population.\\n  Sixth, this bill creates the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and \\nSustainability Program, from a bill that I have long championed to help \\ndrinking water plants combat the effects of climate change. This \\nprogram will award grants to increase the resiliency and adaptability \\nof water systems to increasingly severe storms and droughts, as well as \\nsea level rise--all caused by climate change.\\n  Water utilities can use the grants to assist in the planning, design, \\nconstruction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of the plant--\\nreally, anything they need to increase their climate preparedness.\\n  I applaud the great work that has been accomplished through this \\nlegislation, and I look forward to continuing the work to advance water \\ninfrastructure investment, including integrated planning and \\naffordability.\\n  From the very beginning, I said that this was a bill that was done in \\nthe right process in the Senate. Input was solicited from every Member \\nof the Senate. The committee reached out to all of the Members. All the \\nmembers of our committee have had input into this legislation. It is \\nbipartisan. It is fiscally responsible, which was a key requirement of \\nthe bill.\\n  It will benefit of our communities. It will help us to meet our \\nfundamental commitment to provide the citizens of this Nation with \\nclean and safe drinking water. It will deal with the challenges we have \\nin storm runoff, as it deals with environmental challenges we have. It \\nis a well-balanced bill.\\n  Once again, I applaud the leadership of Senators Barrasso and Carper \\nand my colleague on the subcommittee, Senator Inhofe, for their \\ntremendous work.\\n  I look forward to voting for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \\ndo the same.\\n  I yield the floor.\",\n",

The most important one is the first one: to thank a \\nlot of people who helped me to chair and oversee the confirmation of \\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh.\\n  I should have given this speech 72 hours ago, but I was in a hurry to \\nget to the airport. So I am making up for lost time now.\\n  As everyone knows, on Saturday the Senate confirmed Judge Brett \\nKavanaugh as our newest Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I \\ncome to the floor to thank the Senate staff who helped to make that \\nconfirmation possible.\\n  Senators don't always recognize their staff as much as we probably \\nshould, but I am proud of the work my staff accomplished over the last \\n3 months as we considered the nomination of Kavanaugh. They have worked \\nvery diligently on this confirmation process of our new Justice, and \\nmost of it was behind the scenes. They put in the long, long work hours \\nrequired, and they did it 7 days a week, if needed. The chairman's team \\ntackled the heavy workload before them, and I am tremendously grateful \\nfor all they did to make this nomination a success.\\n  First, on my staff, I would like to recognize my Judiciary counsel \\nstaff director, Kolan Davis. Kolan's experience and sound judgment \\nkeeps me out of a lot of trouble. I value his counsel today, just as I \\nhave for the last 33 years that he has been on my staff.\\n  By my side right here today is Mike Davis, the Judiciary Committee's \\nchief counsel for nominations and also an Iowan. He graduated from the \\nUniversity of Iowa and Iowa Law. Mike brought the tenacity, diligence, \\nand everything else that was needed to lead Kavanaugh's confirmation.\\n  The permanent nomination unit for the Senate Judiciary Committee, \\nworking with Mike Davis, includes Lauren Mehler, Steve Kenny, Katharine \\nWilley, and Jessica Vu. Each of them worked incredibly hard. They have \\nworked hard on all nominations of lifetime appointments to the Federal \\njudiciary and over a long period of time, not just on Kavanaugh. Their \\nhard work is shown by the record number of judges the Senate has \\nconfirmed this Congress. I think the number is 67 so far, besides 2 \\nSupreme Court Justices. I believe there are 41 on the calendar right \\nnow.\\n  In addition to this team, Andrew Ferguson joined my staff to lead the \\nteam of special counsels to specifically assist with the Supreme Court \\nnomination. Andrew led by example with his tireless work ethic and, of \\ncourse, his legal talent.\\n  I also want to thank special counsels Tyler Badgley, Lucas Croslow, \\nColleen Ernst, Megan McGlynn, and Collin White. This team read every \\nword of Justice Kavanaugh's more than 500,000 pages from his time as an \\nexecutive branch lawyer, the 307 opinions he authored on the DC Circuit \\nCourt, and all other documents relevant to his nomination.\\n  Rachel Mitchell was part of this special counsel team, offering her \\nexpertise and many years of experience at a time when we needed extra \\nhelp when we had Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh before our committee for \\na second set of hearings.\\n  Law clerks Tim Rodriguez, Camille Peeples, Abby Hollenstein, Dario \\nCamacho, Elizabeth Donald, Michael Talent, Bob Minchin, Nathan \\nWilliams, Sam Adkisson, and Asher Perez had the opportunity to \\ncontribute and learn during this nomination. I thank them for their \\nhard work and service here in the Senate, on top of their rigorous \\neducation. I thank the intern Jacob Ramer for his contribution as well.\\n  Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation process resulted in a record number \\nof pages available to Senators, including questions for the record. \\nThis team handled it all.\\n  Over the course of my Senate service, I have established a reputation \\nfor my oversight work. I am equipped with a permanent staff of \\nexperienced investigators. When allegations of sexual assault were \\nbrought to my attention on September 13, I was fortunate to have this \\nexperienced and highly regarded division of my staff already on the job\\n\\n[[Page S6713]]\\n\\nto help run down every question and allegation we received.\\n  I thank DeLisa Lay, Patrick Davis, Josh Flynn-Brown, Katherine Nikas, \\nDaniel Parker, and executive branch detailee Andy Hromyak for their \\ndedication to investigation, oversight, and accountability.\\n  I also want to thank my talented communications team: Judiciary \\nCommittee communications director Taylor Foy and Judiciary Committee \\npress secretary George Hartmann, as well as Michael Zona, Nicole \\nTieman, and Alexa Den Herder for their hard work. October 6 will be a \\nmemorable date for Taylor, marking both his wedding anniversary and the \\nday Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed.\\n  I am thankful for my personal office staff, led by my chief of staff, \\nJill Kozeny. She has been on my staff for 31 years. I have long \\nappreciated Jill's advice and all of her hard work on my behalf.\\n  I am also grateful for Jennifer Heins, who makes a tremendous \\ncontribution every day, and every staffer who was part of this \\nconfirmation process, including Penne Barton, Zach Schultz, Katelyn \\nSchultz, Josie Wagler, and my State staff, who had to answer a lot of \\ntelephone calls over a period of 3 months, just dealing with people for \\nand against the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.\\n  I very much appreciate the rest of my Judiciary Committee staff, \\nincluding my deputy staff director, Rita Lari, who took care of things \\nwhile I was on the floor and during the long hours in the hearing.\\n  Finally, I appreciate the work of Leader McConnell's staff, most \\nimportantly, John Abegg.\\n\\n\\n                 Religious Freedom in China and Taiwan\\n\\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, October 10, is the 107th national day of the \\nRepublic of China on Taiwan.\\n  I would like to extend my congratulations to the people of Taiwan on \\nthis very important occasion and to express my appreciation for the \\nU.S.-Taiwan relations. We were allies in World War II and have been \\nclose strategic and economic partners for a very long time. However, as \\nthe Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan has evolved into a \\nthriving free-market democracy that is today, our relationship has even \\ndeepened and strengthened in a way that can only happen when two \\ncountries share core values.\\n  There are times when the economic or geopolitical interests of the \\nUnited States are aligned with those of another country that does not \\nfully embrace freedom as we do--whether that freedom is in the \\nmarketplace of goods and services or the marketplace of ideas in a \\ndemocratic context. We can and should seek to engage with countries \\nthat do not share our values where it is in our national interest, and \\nwe do that.\\n  Still, those relationships remain contingent on weighing economic and \\nsecurity costs and benefits. On the other hand, with free-market \\ndemocracies like Taiwan, there is at the heart of our relationship a \\nvery high degree of mutual understanding underpinning all of our \\ninteractions. Our shared values mean that our long-term economic and \\nstrategic interests are likely to remain aligned. For instance, market \\neconomies are more likely to seek mutually beneficial free and fair \\ntrade. Democracies tend not to seek hegemony but cooperation. In short, \\nour shared values provide the basis for an enduring and stable bond \\nthat can only exist between free people.\\n  One of those fundamental values that is dear to my heart is religious \\nfreedom. I know my colleagues are aware of the disturbing reports out \\nof the People's Republic of China about the closing and destruction of \\nchurches and the burning of Bibles. That is something we in the United \\nStates just do not understand how anybody, any country, could take this \\nsituation and think: Who is afraid of worshiping God? Well, it seems \\nthey have some problem in China.\\n\\n  In Xinjiang Province, the Chinese Government has rounded up over 1 \\nmillion Uighurs and Kazakh Muslims. Tibetan Buddhists and practitioners \\nof Falun Gong have also long had their freedom to practice their \\nbeliefs suppressed. This should disturb all free people.\\n  Of course, the Communist leaders of China have excuses for their \\nbehavior. One of these is the need for sinicization of nonnative \\nreligions. In other words, they think religions like Christianity as \\nfreely practiced are somehow not compatible with Chinese society. Of \\ncourse, from our point of view, that is strictly nuts.\\n  Just look at Taiwan. It has the same Chinese history, the same \\nChinese language, the same Chinese culture as mainland China. Yet, on \\nTaiwan, Christians and other religious groups practice their faith \\nfreely. No one gives even a second thought to whether this is \\ncompatible with their history and tradition because it is a matter of \\nconscience, not a matter of undercutting the government. That is why I \\ndon't understand why it is a problem for Beijing.\\n  In fact, Taiwan has arguably preserved traditional Chinese cultures \\nbetter than on the mainland. Chiang Kai-shek was able to rescue and \\nbring to Taiwan some of the most valuable treasures from Chinese \\nhistory. Of course, these items in Taiwanese society, in general, were \\nspared the horrors of the cultural revolution. Of course, the cultural \\nrevolution was when the Communist Party of China destroyed an untold \\nnumber of historical artifacts as well as cultural and religious sites. \\nAncient Chinese texts were burned, and there were massive human rights \\nabuses.\\n  Some have suggested that recent developments in China are the \\nbeginning of a new sort of cultural revolution. I hope not because we \\nknow what the results of that were 50 or 60 years ago.\\n  Whatever the Communist Chinese Government is thinking, its actions \\nhave shattered many illusions. The hope held by many in the United \\nStates was that robust engagement with the People's Republic of China \\non an economic and political level would help it to evolve into a free \\nmarket democracy. That hope has now dimmed significantly. Things seem \\nto be going quite in the opposite direction.\\n  This is a bad sign, then, for U.S.-China relations. If the Chinese \\nleaders would like to correct their current course and improve \\nrelations with the United States, just take the example of Taiwan. Just \\nlook across the Taiwan Strait for that model: Chinese people, just like \\nthey are in Beijing.\\n  As the people of Taiwan celebrate their national day, I would like to \\nthank them for their friendship with our great country. The Republic of \\nChina on Taiwan continues to be a strong partner in trade, security, \\nand human rights. In fact, I should note that a delegation from Taiwan \\nrecently visited my home State of Iowa to increase their purchases of \\nsoybeans, and I greatly appreciate that, along with 88,000 Iowa \\nfarmers.\\n  Finally, I would like to thank Taiwan for being a model of a free and \\ndemocratic society when it can have a mutually beneficial partnership \\nwith the United States.\\n  I yield the floor.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, I rise on behalf of 152,000 of my \\nconstituents in Montana with preexisting conditions. These are folks \\nwho are struggling with things like diabetes and heart disease and \\nasthma and cancer. Many of them are just one medical bill away from \\nbankruptcy. Thankfully, their health insurance is there for them when \\nthey need it, whether it be for a joint replacement or to undergo chemo \\nor to have a baby.\\n  Federal law holds health insurance companies accountable that their \\nplans cover us when we need it. Unfortunately, those rules are being \\ntossed out so big insurance can make a quick buck at the expense of \\nworking families.\\n  Just last week, health insurance companies started flooding the \\nmarket with junk plans. These plans are marketed as cheap insurance \\nthat will keep you healthy. Fifty bucks a month for full coverage, they \\nsay; $8.95 a week for top-rated coverage, they claim. Now, that is a \\nheck of a deal.\\n  Well, not so fast. They are total and complete shams. If you read the \\nfine print, you will discover that dialysis, blood pressure pills, and \\nx rays aren't covered. In fact, most things are not covered.\\n  Originally, insurance companies designed these plans to provide \\nstopgap coverage when you changed jobs or needed health insurance for \\njust a few months. They figured you could get by\\n\\n[[Page S6714]]\\n\\nwith a bare-bones policy for a month or two. They were never designed \\nto provide coverage for an entire year, let alone three, but now that \\nhas all changed.\\n  Starting last week, health insurance companies now have permission to \\nsell long-term junk plans to Montana's families. What was once a short-\\nterm solution is now becoming a long-term problem.\\n  So let's ask ourselves why we buy insurance in the first place. It is \\nfor risk management. Why do we buy auto insurance? It is in case you \\nget in an auto wreck. You hope you never have to use it, but if you do, \\nyou need that insurance to take care of that automobile to get it back \\non the road again.\\n  Why do we buy fire insurance? In case you have a fire. You hope it \\nnever ever happens, but every once in a while it does, and if you are \\nunfortunate and it happens to you, you have fire insurance to rebuild \\nyour home.\\n  I am a farmer. Why do you have crop insurance? You have crop \\ninsurance in that case where Mother Nature may not be smiling upon you; \\nyou may not get the rain at the appropriate time or you may get a \\nhailstorm that wipes you out. You hope it never happens, but if it \\ndoes, you have that crop insurance you can depend upon to manage your \\nrisk.\\n  So why do you buy health insurance? Is it because you plan on getting \\nsick? I don't think so. It is because, if you get sick, you will need \\nthe coverage. If you end up with high blood pressure, you have the \\ncoverage to help offset those costs.\\n  Unfortunately, with these junk plans, they are called junk for a \\nreason--because they don't cover anything. They give you a false sense \\nof hope and a false sense of coverage and you have no coverage.\\n  I want to take you back to 1965. In 1965, my parents bought an \\naccident insurance policy. It was supposed to cover accidents. Guess \\nwhat happened in 1965. I got in a little accident with a meat grinder, \\nand that insurance policy covered nothing. My folks had to dig deep and \\npay for the cost. When they thought they had insurance, they had \\nnothing.\\n  I was young, but I can still remember how angry my father was that \\nthey had been sold a bill of goods. That is exactly what it is with \\nthese junk insurance plans.\\n  Montanans are getting grifted. They are being sold a bill of goods. \\nThey are being lied to, deceived, and I will do whatever I can do to \\nkeep the junk out of our healthcare.\\n  We must hold big insurance companies accountable. We cannot let \\ncorporations swindle folks who need health insurance when, in the end, \\nthey have nothing.\\n  The bill before us this week does that. It keeps short-term plans \\nshort term. It stops insurance companies from selling garbage plans \\nthat don't cover preexisting conditions.\\n  That is why I am urging my colleagues to vote for this resolution, to \\nstand up for Montanans across the State and Americans across this \\ncountry. These are folks who work hard to put food on the table, and \\nthey shouldn't have to choose between a doctor's appointment and a \\nutility bill.\\n  Today I rise for those folks from Miles City, Harlowton, and Libby \\nand promise to defend them from these shoddy plans.\\n  With that, I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, water infrastructure, a bill that we \\nhave just moved to a positive cloture vote, 96 to 3--water \\ninfrastructure is important to every State, as we see by this vote--\\nevery territory, every community, and every Tribe in this country. \\nThese systems support America's economic growth and our \\ncompetitiveness. They deliver drinking water and treat wastewater. They \\nprovide water for crops, cattle, and small businesses. They are used to \\nship American-made goods from the heartland to the coasts and around \\nthe world. They keep homes safe from dangerous flood waters; they store \\nwater for times of drought.\\n  These systems are vital to our country. We must maintain, upgrade, \\nand, where necessary, build them.\\n  During the State of the Union Address this year, President Trump \\ncalled on Congress to act on infrastructure. He said we will build \\nAmerica's infrastructure ``with American heart, American hands, and \\nAmerican grit.''\\n  Water infrastructure is a major part of the President's call. That is \\nwhy I introduced America's Water Infrastructure Act, along with my \\nfellow leaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators \\nCarper, Inhofe, and Cardin. Several other committee members were also \\ncosponsors, including Senators Capito, Wicker, Van Hollen, Boozman, \\nWhitehouse, and Sullivan.\\n  Politico called America's Water Infrastructure Act the most \\nsignificant infrastructure legislation to be taken up under the Trump \\nadministration so far. This legislation passed the Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee in the Senate unanimously, 21 to 0.\\n  Last month, the same leaders from our committee and the leadership of \\nthe committees in the House of Representatives reached a deal on \\nhistoric comprehensive water infrastructure legislation. America's \\nWater Infrastructure Act now has broad bicameral and bipartisan \\nsupport.\\n  Our bill will help grow the economy, will cut Washington redtape, and \\nwill keep communities safe.\\n  Authorizing important water projects will create jobs that will spur \\neconomic growth. The legislation will help deepen nationally \\nsignificant ports and maintain the navigability of inland waterways. It \\nis going to increase storage in the West and build new flood management \\ninfrastructure.\\n  This bill will fix aging dams and irrigation systems across the \\ncountry. Upgrading these systems will ensure that ranchers and farmers \\nwill get the water that they rely on.\\n  It will also help communities recover from devastating storms like \\nHurricane Florence and the damage it left along the east coast, \\nespecially in North and South Carolina.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act also cuts Washington redtape. As \\nchairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \\nheard time and again how State and local leaders know better than \\nWashington which projects would have the most positive impact on their \\ncommunity. Our bill will give local experts an increased role in \\nprioritizing which Army Corps projects get built.\\n  When a local partner takes over an Army Corps of Engineer's flood \\ncontrol project, they will no longer need to worry about obtaining \\nbrandnew permits. The Army Corps will simply transfer its authority to \\nthe local partner so that new permits are no longer necessary.\\n  The government will also provide technical assistance to smaller \\ncommunities to make it simpler for them to comply with environmental \\nlaws.\\n  Leveraging Federal dollars is an important element of President \\nTrump's infrastructure plan. We included language to help smaller rural \\ncommunities leverage their resources so that they can build water \\ninfrastructure projects. Federal leveraging programs, particularly the \\nWater Infrastructure Flexibility Act, allow taxpayers to get the most \\nbang for their buck.\\n  In the past, smaller rural communities have had trouble accessing \\nthese dollars. The language in our consensus bill will give these rural \\ncommunities the chance to compete for these funds and the ability to \\nparticipate in these successful programs.\\n  Cutting redtape and increasing access to these leveraging programs \\nwill help us get projects done faster, better, cheaper, and smarter. \\nThat is just common sense.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act is also about safety. In recent \\nyears, we have seen the damage that floods and droughts can cause. We \\nmust maintain and improve our dams, our beach fronts, our levies, and \\nour reservoirs.\\n  Our bill takes steps to address the backlog of maintenance needs of \\nthese infrastructure systems. It also creates a permanent program to \\nfind solutions for floods caused by ice jams.\\n  In the spring, and certainly in Wyoming, thawing ice and snow create \\njams in rivers and can cause them to overflow their banks. In my home \\nState of Wyoming, ice jam floods have been devastating for the towns of \\nGreybull and Worland. America's Water Infrastructure Act authorizes \\nimportant programs to find permanent ways to prevent these types of \\nfloods.\\n  This bill is about more than just flood prevention. It is the most \\nsignificant drinking water legislation in decades. The bill authorizes \\nfunds to repair aging drinking water systems.\\n  For the first time since 1996--that is 22 years ago--Congress will be \\nauthorizing the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. These funds give \\nStates certainty--certainty that they can meet their drinking water \\nneeds. That is a big deal.\\n  There is a line that people say in Wyoming. It was originally \\nattributed to Mark Twain. The line is this: Whiskey is for drinking; \\nwater is for fighting over. That is not the case with America's Water \\nInfrastructure Act.\\n\\n[[Page S6716]]\\n\\n  That is not the case with America's Water Infrastructure Act. \\nDemocrats and Republicans are working together in a bipartisan way. The \\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate are working together in a \\nbicameral way. The House of Representatives passed this consensus bill \\nunanimously by voice vote. Now it is the Senate's turn. We all know how \\nimportant this legislation is for our country, for our States, and for \\nour constituents. The bill is bipartisan and is fiscally responsible. \\nAmerica's Water Infrastructure Act actually reduces the deficit.\\n  I thank Ranking Member Carper and Subcommittee Chairman Inhofe and \\nSubcommittee Ranking Member Cardin and their staffs for their \\nleadership in working through this process. They have been wonderful \\npartners in writing legislation that will have a real impact all across \\nAmerica. This bill is for all of America. It will have a real impact in \\nour rural areas and in our big cities. It will help communities in the \\nheartland and communities on the coasts.\\n  It is now time to pass this legislation. Let's pass the American \\nWater Infrastructure Act and send it to President Trump for his \\nsignature.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Delaware.\",\n",
       " ' CARPER. ',\n",
       " \"Mr. President, I rise today, along with the chairman, \\nSenator Barrasso, to further discuss the important piece of \\ninfrastructure legislation that he has outlined that will positively \\naffect the States of every Member of this body. I want to encourage \\neach of our colleagues to support it.\\n  Over the course of August and early September, the Senate Environment \\nand Public Works Committee reached an agreement with our counterparts \\nin the House to advance America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018.\\n  Our chairman, John Barrasso, and I coauthored this bill and did so \\nwith the help of the majority and minority staffs of the Environment \\nand Public Works Committee over the better part of this past year. I \\nwant to take a moment to thank our chairman, as I have earlier, for his \\nleadership. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \\nInfrastructure Subcommittee of EPW, Jim Inhofe and Ben Cardin, for \\ntheir leadership in producing this critical bipartisan legislation.\\n  I want to thank the members of their staffs and especially the \\nmajority and minority member EPW staffs, without whose help this bill \\nwould not be before us today. Collectively, you have done a terrific \\njob. I am proud of you. As we say in the Navy, Bravo Zulu, which means \\n``well done.''\\n  As some of you may recall, the Senate's version of the bill was \\nreported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously \\na few months back. On September 13, the bill passed the House of \\nRepresentatives unanimously on a voice vote.\\n  People back home say to me: Why can't you just work together? Well, \\nin this case, we have, and I think the results speak for themselves. I \\nam hopeful and encouraged that this bill will receive the same strong \\nsupport in the Senate this week.\\n  In a Congress and a country that are all too often divided, it is \\nrefreshing to me and I think to others as well that we have been able \\nto come together to authorize water infrastructure and drinking water \\nprograms that are both vital and critical to the American people's way \\nof life.\\n  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 is a win-win for our \\nNation's economy and for our environment. This bill should serve as a \\nmodel for how we can get meaningful legislation done in Congress, and I \\nhope it will serve as a model.\\n  This legislation supports the ongoing work of the U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers. It does so by reauthorizing the Corps' program for flood \\ncontrol, for beach and shoreline maintenance, and for the maintenance \\nof inland and coastal waterways through which the goods that enter and \\ndepart from American ports travel.\\n  The Corps' Civil Works Program is our Nation's largest and I believe \\nthe world's biggest water resources undertaking. This program addresses \\na wide variety of priorities, including ship navigability; flood risk \\nmanagement; beach and shoreline protection; renewable energy, such as \\nhydropower; water supply; and environmental restoration and \\nstewardship. In fact, over 99 percent of U.S. overseas trade moves \\nthrough the waterways which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is \\nresponsible for maintaining. Think of that--99 percent.\\n  In fact, this bill supports the Corps' operation and maintenance of \\n13,000 miles of commercial deep-draft ship channels and 12,000 miles of \\ncommercial inland waterways. These ports and waterways serve a combined \\n40 States and transport much of our country's waterborne cargo.\\n  The new authorizations that this bill provides are critically needed. \\nMuch of the infrastructure that the Corps is responsible for across the \\ncountry now exceeds its useful lifespan. As a result, we have an \\nenormous construction backlog of needed infrastructure investments. The \\nlatest estimates from the Army Corps indicate that the overall \\nconstruction backlog is in the neighborhood of $96 billion, while the \\nannual budget of the Army Corps hovers around $4.6 billion. Think of \\nthat--$96 billion on the one hand and $4.6 billion on the other hand. \\nThose two numbers reflect the extraordinary challenge the Army Corps \\nfaces--a challenge we begin to address with this legislation. This bill \\naddresses that backlog by providing new tools that will allow the \\ngovernment to partner with the Corps and leverage existing resources to \\nmake sure we get the most bang for our buck.\\n  This legislation also increases local participation, transparency, \\nand accountability in developing the Army Corps' annual budget. It is \\nmy hope that enhanced local participation will allow for a more \\ntransparent and long-term look at the Corps' activities and help build \\na greater groundswell of support for increased appropriations to fund \\nthe agency's initiatives.\\n  The measure before us also authorizes critical Corps of Engineers \\ndisaster programs. When disaster strikes, the Federal Government often \\nsteps in and helps, as it did last year in Puerto Rico, \\nFlorida, Louisiana, Texas, and this year in the Carolinas. A large part \\nof that help is provided by the Army Corps of Engineers--something that \\nmay come as a surprise to Americans who don't realize the critical role \\nthe Corps plays in responding to all sorts of emergencies.\\n\\n  In addition, this bill includes new authorities to help protect \\ncommunities and ecosystems in coastal States like Delaware and Maryland \\nand States across our country from some of the worst impacts of extreme \\nweather events. This measure includes provisions that allow communities \\nto recover more quickly, too, when disaster does strike and facilitates \\nrebuilding facilities in ways that are more resilient to future storms.\\n  This legislation also makes key changes in emergency response, post-\\ndisaster recovery, and resiliency efforts so that the Army Corps thinks \\nlong-term instead of short-term when it selects solutions that it will \\nimplement. But the bill goes even further. It enables the Corps to \\npursue the best possible solutions to make communities more resistant \\nto storm damage, whether those solutions are a traditionally \\nconstructed levee or a natural alternative, like the reconstructed \\ndunes we are using along the Delaware coast and other places too.\\n  Earlier this year, NOAA announced that the total cost for extreme \\nweather and climate events in 2017 exceeded $300 billion. That is a new \\nU.S. annual record--$300 billion in 1 year, last year. It is not a \\nmatter of if the next extreme weather event is coming, it is a matter \\nof when. As storm events, such as Hurricane Florence, grow more \\npowerful and prevalent, threatening American lives and infrastructure, \\nthe passage of this bill--a bill that will help protect coastal \\ncommunities from the risk of flooding--has never been more important.\\n  In addition to strengthening key Corps programs, this bill also \\naddresses key programs at EPA for major drinking water and wastewater \\nneeds across our country. For the first time in over 20 years, this \\nbill reauthorizes the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, too. \\nThat program provides Federal assistance to help communities with clean \\ndrinking water. It does so through no-interest, low-interest, and\\n\\n[[Page S6717]]\\n\\nforgivable loans that help communities in a variety of ways gain access \\nto capital that would otherwise be unavailable. It is my hope that one \\nday we can eventually add grants back into this program for communities \\nthat need the help the most, but that is probably a longer conversation \\nsomewhere down the line.\\n  The ongoing crisis in Flint that we are now seeing play out in far \\ntoo many communities across our country is tragic but avoidable if we \\ninvest in water infrastructure more wisely. This bill makes it clear \\nthat we have learned our lesson, and we are beginning to take some \\nsteps to address this enormous challenge.\\n  Some of our colleagues may recall that earlier this year Senator \\nDuckworth and I hosted a drinking water roundtable here on Capitol \\nHill. The image of her holding up in her hand a baby bottle with \\nformula made from contaminated drinking water is an image that is hard \\nfor me to forget.\\n  This bill authorizes more resources for EPA to make sure that every \\nparent, no matter what their ZIP Code is, where they live, can be \\nconfident that the water coming out of the tap at home or at their \\nchildren's school is safe for their kids to drink. Toward that end, \\nthis legislation not only reauthorizes the safe drinking water \\nrevolving loan program, it nearly doubles its funding. By fiscal year \\n2021, the program will grow from the current authorization of $1 \\nbillion to almost $2 billion.\\n  Perhaps most notably, especially in light of the avoidable \\ndevastation and tragedy we saw in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and \\nHarvey, this bill authorizes $100 million to repair drinking water \\nsystems damaged by storms and creates a new program that helps protect \\ndrinking water systems from extreme weather events.\\n  This legislation allows States that detect contaminants in drinking \\nwater to provide assistance to residents who depend on private water \\nwells. This provision should matter to every Member of Congress whose \\nresidents rely significantly on wells for their water consumption \\nneeds, and we have them in every single State across America. I don't \\nknow about other States, but one in six Delawareans depends on private \\nwells for their drinking water. It is not fair that if contaminants end \\nup in their water through no fault of the resident, the resident has to \\nfind a way to rectify that situation on their own. Without this bill, \\nthese taxpayers get no support, and that is not right.\\n  This bill goes way beyond addressing emergency situations. It \\nprovides a framework for updating and expanding water infrastructure \\nsystems throughout our country at both the EPA and the Army Corps of \\nEngineers.\\n  As I mentioned earlier, the bill authorizes $50 million for technical \\nassistance to help schools and daycare centers deal with lead \\ncontamination in their drinking water and another $5 million per year \\nin grants for modernizing, testing, and replacing the lead components \\nthat are causing the water contamination. This provision is going to be \\nparticularly helpful in places like Chicago and Baltimore, where there \\nare schools operating with no usable drinking water fountains.\\n  Oftentimes, our water infrastructure is the forgotten leg of the \\ninfrastructure stool. We rightly worry about the infrastructure we can \\nsee, such as bridges, highways, airports, and railroads, but our water \\ninfrastructure--our pipes, shipping channels, flood control structures; \\nthe infrastructure we don't see but rely on every day--is also in \\ndesperate need of investment in many parts of America.\\n  Before I yield the floor today, I want to again thank our chairman, \\nSenator Barrasso, and our Senators from Maryland and Oklahoma who are \\nthe cochairs of the Infrastructure Subcommittee of Environment and \\nPublic Works and other members of our committee and frankly those who \\nare not fortunate enough to serve on our committee. I thank them for \\ntheir hard work throughout this process.\\n  I thank our colleagues over in the House--Congressmen Shuster, \\nDeFazio, Walden, and Pallone--who were great partners of ours. When we \\nwork together as Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers, we are \\nstronger, and when we are stronger here, we are stronger across our \\ncountry.\\n  Finally, I thank the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Army Corps of \\nEngineers, R.D. James, who has made this legislation a priority for the \\nArmy Corps and for the administration. He and his team worked with us \\nto craft a bill that I think we can all be proud of, and I am.\\n  I want to mention again that as smart as John Barrasso and I and the \\nother Senators who serve on our committee and here in the Senate are, \\nthis bill wouldn't be before us if we didn't have some very smart \\npeople on our staffs. One is sitting right here next to me today, and \\nsome others are standing behind me. I see over on the Republican \\nmajority side some terrific members of staff who work under the \\nleadership of our chairman. I want to take a moment to take my hat \\noff--I wish I were wearing my hat. If I were, I would take it off to \\nall of you, as well.\\n\\n  Let me end today with an African proverb that I think is particularly \\nrelevant. It goes something like this: If you want to go fast, travel \\nalone. If you want to go far, travel together.\\n  By working together, we crafted legislation that is both substantive \\nand needed. This proposal stands as a timely example of how we can set \\naside our differences and get meaningful work done for the people who \\nsent us here and expected us to accomplish really important things like \\nthis on their behalf.\\n  The underlying bill before us is one that delivers a lot of good to \\nthe American people. At the same time, it represents good public policy \\nthat is fiscally responsible. It is deserving of the support of our \\ncolleagues in the Senate. I hope they will join us in supporting its \\npassage.\\n  I yield the floor.\",\n",

       " \"Mr. President, while it is perhaps not in line with \\nofficial and genuine Senate protocol, I also want to use this \\nopportunity to congratulate my good friend in the Chair on the \\nwonderful events of last weekend for his family.\\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss my colleague \\nSenator\\n\\n[[Page S6718]]\\n\\nBaldwin's resolution that would protect the millions of Americans in \\nWisconsin and Oregon and all across the land who are faced with \\npreexisting health conditions.\\n  This has been an area I have focused on since my days as codirector \\nof the Oregon Gray Panthers because preexisting conditions is kind of \\nfancy lingo that people talk about as it relates to healthcare policy, \\nbut really what it is all about is, if you have cancer or diabetes or \\nheart disease or asthma or any one of a score of healthcare conditions, \\nbefore the Affordable Care Act, you were just in a world of hurt, \\nliterally and figuratively. In effect, the healthcare system then was \\nfor the healthy and the wealthy. If you were healthy, there was nothing \\nto worry about--no preexisting condition. If you were wealthy, you just \\npaid the bills, but if you had preexisting conditions, as millions and \\nmillions of Americans have, then you were really out of luck.\\n\\n  So then, along came the Affordable Care Act. I had written a piece of \\nlegislation, the Healthy Americans Act, with seven Democrats and seven \\nRepublicans as cosponsors. It had airtight, loophole-free protection \\nfor Americans against discrimination if they had preexisting \\nconditions. That provision from the Healthy Americans Act, to a very \\ngreat extent, made its way into the Affordable Care Act. That is why \\nmillions of Americans were able to go to bed at night with a sense of \\ncomfort and a sense that if they did have healthcare conditions, the \\ninsurance companies wouldn't be able to just clobber them with higher \\ncosts. Unfortunately, we have the Trump administration's wanting to \\nbring back the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy and \\nallow discrimination against people with preexisting conditions.\\n  The flip side of the preexisting condition coin is junk insurance--\\nselling junk insurance that really isn't worth a whole lot more than \\nthe paper it is written on. Boy, do I know something about junk \\ninsurance because that is how I started my time in public service, when \\nsenior citizens were sold 15 to 20 policies. Again, the rip-offs were \\nbuilt in. Back then, if you had one policy and you had another policy \\nthat offered similar coverage, they canceled each other out, and the \\nsenior got nothing. It was junk insurance. If we go back to the days \\nwhen they discriminated against people with preexisting conditions, we \\nare going to have junk insurance all over again.\\n  I am going to begin with the Trump administration's record on this.\\n  First of all, if you are a scam artist who is peddling junk plans, \\nthe Trump administration has your back. If you are a person with a \\npreexisting condition, the Trump administration is advancing policies \\nthat will make both your health and your wallet in far worse shape. \\nNow, the Trump officials get up and talk about the benefits of short-\\nterm plans. They will use buzz words like ``flexibility'' and \\n``patient-centered care,'' but I want everybody to be clear that it is \\njunk insurance, plain and simple. It is putting a whole lot of lipstick \\non a frog.\\n  These junk insurance plans the Trump administration has revived \\nrepresent the very worst of industry tricks and abuses. They punish \\nAmericans who really need healthcare. If you are young, if you are \\nhealthy, and if you are wealthy, as I have said, there is nothing to \\nworry about. With junk plans, you have a glide path to put scams on \\nthose with preexisting conditions like heart disease, cancer, and \\nmental illness. They exist to prey on older Americans--on women, on the \\nless fortunate--particularly a group that I have thought was the heart \\nof where healthcare reform ought to go--to the folks between 55 and 65.\\n  As I have indicated, junk plans are not new. Congress and the \\nAmerican people have rejected them before. I mentioned my history with \\nthe Oregon Gray Panthers. Big, thick stacks of legalese that nobody \\ncould understand were always hyped to the seniors. They were going to \\nfill the gaps in Medicare. It was called Medigap. Back then, it was \\nreally just A and B. It didn't have D and Medicare Advantage and all \\nkinds of other things. It was just A and B.\\n  You had seniors frightened that the gaps in Medicare were going to \\nconsume any savings they might have. So every time a fast-talking \\nsalesperson came through, a senior would buy a policy. When I was the \\ndirector of the Gray Panthers, it was common to go to seniors' homes, \\nand they would actually go to a closet and pull out a shoebox full of \\nthese worthless policies. I really fear we are looking at going back to \\nthose days.\\n  The fact is that Congress finally cracked down on those Medigap rip-\\noffs. I had an opportunity to be a part of that effort as a Member of \\nthe other body, the House, but a lot of people got hurt in the process.\\n  Junk insurance was not just a problem for seniors. A few years ago, \\nthe Affordable Care Act was designed, as I mentioned, in terms of the \\nHealthy Americans Act, to make sure that junk insurance would be \\neliminated across the board. Across the board, we would say in our \\ncountry, we are going to have ironclad, loophole-free guarantees that \\nno American would ever face discrimination over a preexisting \\ncondition.\\n  By the way, that used to be a bipartisan proposition. The fact is \\nthat still serving in this body are a number of my colleagues on the \\nRepublican side who are cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act, with \\nthat ironclad, loophole-free protection for those with preexisting \\nconditions. So it is not as if somebody just kind of brought this up as \\na partisan issue. It was bipartisan then. Republican Members of this \\nbody, distinguished colleagues, were cosponsors of that Healthy \\nAmericans Act proposition. Now the Trump administration is trying to \\nturn back the clock. It wants to make junk plans great again--a forced \\nmarch back to those days that I described that were only for the \\nhealthy and the wealthy.\\n\\n  The open enrollment plan for health insurance is coming up very \\nquickly. The Trump administration has cut it in half so that it is \\ngoing to last only a few weeks this year. That means, during the \\nholidays, when Americans are traveling, shopping, and spending time \\nwith family, they will also have to make some judgments about health \\ninsurance. Because of the Trump administration's actions, these junk \\ninsurance policies are going to be peddled at the same time as \\ninsurance that would actually cover, meaningfully, the healthcare that \\nour people need.\\n  What they are going to be doing with these Trump changes is making \\nlife easy for the scam artists but a nightmare for so many Americans \\nwho, day in and day out, walk an economic tightrope just trying to pay \\nfor essentials. These rip-off artists under the Trump plan are going to \\nhave a green light to steal the money Americans pay in premiums and for \\nother expenses. According to a recent study, sometimes as much as $2 \\nout of every $3 is wasted on overhead with these administrative costs \\nand junk insurance profits in these flawed policies that the Trump \\nadministration wants to foist off on Americans.\\n  The disastrous effects of junk insurance aren't limited to those who \\nget conned into buying it. By bringing junk plans back, the Trump \\nadministration, in effect, goes out and swings a wrecking ball into the \\nprivate health insurance markets in our country. It raises costs across \\nthe board, and Americans waste their hard-earned dollars.\\n  Senator Baldwin has a resolution, and I commend my colleague from \\nWisconsin on her effort on this. She came and talked with me about this \\nearly on, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. We \\nhave jurisdiction over something like $1 trillion worth of health \\nspending. I really appreciate the expertise and the passion that \\nSenator Baldwin has brought to this issue, and we saw it in her very \\nfirst presentation on what she wanted to do. Her resolution is the \\nSenate's best opportunity to put a stop to the scams that I have \\ndescribed. It would throw the Trump administration's junk insurance \\nrules out, and with Senator Baldwin's proposal, it would restore the \\nprotections that millions of Americans count on each day.\\n  The Democrats in the Senate are going to stand up for Americans with \\npreexisting conditions, and I hope colleagues on the other side will \\njoin us. I recognize that the Trump administration will not, but my \\nhope is that we will have colleagues on the other side supporting us \\nfor Senator Baldwin's resolution.\\n\\n[[Page S6719]]\\n\\n  In addition, as if this were not enough of an injury foisted on \\nvulnerable Americans, the Trump administration has put forward a \\nnominee for a seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals who made \\nhealthcare sabotage one of his top priorities at the Trump Justice \\nDepartment. Chad Readler, currently the Deputy Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral, in my view, is the wrong choice to be a Federal judge.\\n  Earlier this year, the Trump administration decided it just wanted to \\nget out of the business of enforcing the rules that protect Americans \\nwith preexisting conditions. In fact, it had to argue in court that it \\ncould abandon that essential part of the Affordable Care Act, which was \\nstill the law of the land the last time I looked. Who did the \\nadministration turn to when it needed to cook up a dubious legal \\nargument that it had no obligation to enforce the law of the land? Chad \\nReadler. In fact, three career attorneys from the Department of Justice \\nlooked at his argument, and they actually withdrew from the case. Three \\ncareer lawyers from the Department of Justice refused to participate.\\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Mr. Readler's nomination \\nearlier this month. His nomination could be sent to the floor of the \\nSenate in the coming weeks, but it ought to be clear that this is a \\nnominee who is not an impartial individual who has the judicial \\ntemperament Americans expect. He is not somebody who ought to be handed \\na seat on the Federal bench and have the power to sign off on the Trump \\nadministration's agenda of healthcare sabotage.\\n  I close with this. The Senate has an opportunity to stand up this \\nweek for the millions of vulnerable Americans who have these \\npreexisting conditions, for the millions of Americans who under the \\nAffordable Care Act can go to bed at night knowing that if they have \\npreexisting conditions, they are not going to lose everything. I am \\nserious when I talk about losing everything. Once you go back to \\ndiscriminating against people with preexisting conditions, you are \\ngoing to go back to job lock and all of the problems we saw associated \\nwith discrimination. If you were in Montana or if you were in Oregon \\nand had a preexisting condition and you got offered a better job on the \\nother side of town, you couldn't go get it because you would not be \\nable to get coverage because there was discrimination against people \\nwith preexisting conditions.\\n  This week the Senate is going to have an opportunity to stand up to \\nthe Trump administration and go to bat for the millions and millions of \\nAmericans who are watching this debate who have preexisting conditions \\nand who are just counting on this body not to turn back the clock and \\nleave them vulnerable again. Senator Baldwin's resolution would prevent \\nthe Trump administration from bringing back the worst abuses of junk \\ninsurance. If it doesn't pass this week, this will be an issue that, in \\nmy view, will come up again and again and again until it is fixed.\\n  Finally, the Readler nomination, in my view, ought to be stopped in \\nits tracks. The Senate ought to tell the administration that it is not \\ngoing to rubberstamp judicial nominees who have proven, demonstrable \\ntrack records of twisting the law in a way that harms the most \\nvulnerable of our citizens.\\n  I note that the majority leader is here.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n\\n                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]"
