### Hi Team!

Our site is built and compiled with Harp for Node.js, a static site generator which empowers us to use templating and precompilers without the need for a web server.

For local development, you must first install Harp with `npm install -g harpjs`. Next, start the Harp development server with `harp server`. When you're ready to compile assets for static deployment, run `harp compile`. That's all there is to it!
